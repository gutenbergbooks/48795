<h2 class="eee">PREFACE.</h2>
<p>I must begin with the same announcement as in
the previous Volume (which I shall henceforward
refer to as &ldquo;Vol. I.,&rdquo; calling the present Volume
&ldquo;Vol. II.&rdquo;), viz. that the Locket, at <a href="#Page_405">p. 405</a>, was drawn
by &lsquo;Miss Alice Havers.&rsquo; And my reason, for not
stating this on the title-page&mdash;that it seems only
due, to the artist of these wonderful pictures, that
his name should stand there alone&mdash;has, I think,
even greater weight in Vol. II. than it had in Vol. I.
Let me call especial attention to the three &ldquo;Little
Birds&rdquo; borders, at pp. <a href="#Page_365">365</a>, <a href="#Page_371">371</a>, <a href="#Page_377">377</a>. The way, in
which he has managed to introduce the most minute
details of the stanzas to be illustrated, seems to me
a triumph of artistic ingenuity.</p>
<p class="tb">Let me here express my sincere gratitude to the
many Reviewers who have noticed, whether favorably
or unfavorably, the previous Volume. Their unfavorable
remarks were, most probably, well-deserved;
the favorable ones less probably so. Both kinds
have no doubt served to make the book known, and
have helped the reading Public to form their opinions
of it. Let me also here assure them that it is not
from any want of respect for their criticisms, that I
<span class="pb" id="Page_x">x</span>
have carefully forborne from reading <i>any</i> of them.
I am strongly of opinion that an author had far
better <i>not</i> read any reviews of his books: the unfavorable
ones are almost certain to make him
cross, and the favorable ones conceited; and <i>neither</i>
of these results is desirable.</p>
<p>Criticisms have, however, reached me from private
sources, to some of which I propose to offer a reply.</p>
<p>One such critic complains that Arthur&rsquo;s strictures,
on sermons and on choristers, are too severe. Let me
say, in reply, that I do <i>not</i> hold myself responsible
for <i>any</i> of the opinions expressed by the characters
in my book. They are simply opinions which, it
seemed to me, might probably be held by the persons
into whose mouths I put them, and which were
worth consideration.</p>
<p>Other critics have objected to certain innovations
in spelling, such as &ldquo;ca&rsquo;n&rsquo;t,&rdquo; &ldquo;wo&rsquo;n&rsquo;t,&rdquo; &ldquo;traveler.&rdquo; In
reply, I can only plead my firm conviction that the
popular usage is <i>wrong</i>. As to &ldquo;ca&rsquo;n&rsquo;t,&rdquo; it will not
be disputed that, in all <i>other</i> words ending in &ldquo;n&rsquo;t,&rdquo;
these letters are an abbreviation of &ldquo;not&rdquo;; and it is
surely absurd to suppose that, in this solitary instance,
&ldquo;not&rdquo; is represented by &ldquo;&rsquo;t&rdquo;! In fact &ldquo;can&rsquo;t&rdquo; is
the <i>proper</i> abbreviation for &ldquo;can it,&rdquo; just as &ldquo;is&rsquo;t&rdquo; is
for &ldquo;is it.&rdquo; Again, in &ldquo;wo&rsquo;n&rsquo;t,&rdquo; the first apostrophe
is needed, because the word &ldquo;would&rdquo; is here <i>abridged</i>
into &ldquo;wo&rdquo;: but I hold it proper to spell &ldquo;don&rsquo;t&rdquo;
with only <i>one</i> apostrophe, because the word &ldquo;do&rdquo; is
here <i>complete</i>. As to such words as &ldquo;traveler,&rdquo; I
hold the correct principle to be, to <i>double</i> the consonant
<span class="pb" id="Page_xi">xi</span>
when the accent falls on that syllable; otherwise
to leave it <i>single</i>. This rule is observed in most
cases (e.g. we double the &ldquo;r&rdquo; in &ldquo;preferred,&rdquo; but
leave it single in &ldquo;offered&rdquo;), so that I am only extending,
to other cases, an existing rule. I admit,
however, that I do not spell &ldquo;parallel,&rdquo; as the rule
would have it; but here we are constrained, by the
etymology, to insert the double &ldquo;l&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="tb">In the Preface to Vol. I. were two puzzles, on which
my readers might exercise their ingenuity. One was,
to detect the 3 lines of &ldquo;padding,&rdquo; which I had found
it necessary to supply in the passage extending from
the top of <a class="x" href="../../48630/48630-h/48630-h.htm#Page_35">p. 35</a> to the middle of <a class="x" href="../../48630/48630-h/48630-h.htm#Page_38">p. 38</a>. They are
the 14th, 15th, and 16th lines of <a class="x" href="../../48630/48630-h/48630-h.htm#Page_37">p. 37</a>. The other
puzzle was, to determine which (if any) of the 8
stanzas of the Gardener&rsquo;s Song (see pp. <a class="x" href="../../48630/48630-h/48630-h.htm#Page_65">65</a>, <a class="x" href="../../48630/48630-h/48630-h.htm#Page_78">78</a>, <a class="x" href="../../48630/48630-h/48630-h.htm#Page_83">83</a>,
<a class="x" href="../../48630/48630-h/48630-h.htm#Page_90">90</a>, <a class="x" href="../../48630/48630-h/48630-h.htm#Page_106">106</a>, <a class="x" href="../../48630/48630-h/48630-h.htm#Page_116">116</a>, <a class="x" href="../../48630/48630-h/48630-h.htm#Page_164">164</a>, <a class="x" href="../../48630/48630-h/48630-h.htm#Page_168">168</a>) were adapted to the context,
and which (if any) had the context adapted to them.
The last of them is the only one that was adapted to
the context, the &ldquo;Garden-Door that opened with a
key&rdquo; having been substituted for some creature (a
Cormorant, I think) &ldquo;that nestled in a tree.&rdquo; At
pp. <a class="x" href="../../48630/48630-h/48630-h.htm#Page_78">78</a>, <a class="x" href="../../48630/48630-h/48630-h.htm#Page_106">106</a>, and <a class="x" href="../../48630/48630-h/48630-h.htm#Page_164">164</a>, the context was adapted to the
stanza. At p. <a class="x" href="../../48630/48630-h/48630-h.htm#Page_90">90</a>, neither stanza nor context was
altered: the connection between them was simply a
piece of good luck.</p>
<p>In the Preface to Vol. I., at pp. <a class="x" href="../../48630/48630-h/48630-h.htm#Page_ix">ix</a>., <a class="x" href="../../48630/48630-h/48630-h.htm#Page_x">x</a>., I gave an
account of the making-up of the story of &ldquo;Sylvie and
Bruno.&rdquo; A few more details may perhaps be acceptable
to my Readers.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_xii">xii</div>
<p>It was in 1873, as I <i>now</i> believe, that the idea
first occurred to me that a little fairy-tale (written,
in 1867, for &ldquo;Aunt Judy&rsquo;s Magazine,&rdquo; under the title
&ldquo;Bruno&rsquo;s Revenge&rdquo;) might serve as the nucleus of a
longer story. This I surmise, from having found the
original draft of the last paragraph of Vol. II., dated
1873. So that this paragraph has been waiting 20
years for its chance of emerging into print&mdash;more
than twice the period so cautiously recommended by
Horace for &lsquo;repressing&rsquo; one&rsquo;s literary efforts!</p>
<p>It was in February, 1885, that I entered into negotiations,
with Mr. Harry Furniss, for illustrating the
book. Most of the substance of <i>both</i> Volumes was
then in existence in manuscript: and my original
intention was to publish the <i>whole</i> story at once.
In September, 1885, I received from Mr. Furniss the
first set of drawings&mdash;the four which illustrate
&ldquo;Peter and Paul&rdquo; (see I. pp. <a class="x" href="../../48630/48630-h/48630-h.htm#Page_144">144</a>, <a class="x" href="../../48630/48630-h/48630-h.htm#Page_147">147</a>, <a class="x" href="../../48630/48630-h/48630-h.htm#Page_150">150</a>, <a class="x" href="../../48630/48630-h/48630-h.htm#Page_154">154</a>): in
November, 1886, I received the second set&mdash;the
three which illustrate the Professor&rsquo;s song about the
&ldquo;little man&rdquo; who had &ldquo;a little gun&rdquo; (Vol. II. pp.
<a href="#Page_265">265</a>, <a href="#Page_266">266</a>, <a href="#Page_267">267</a>): and in January, 1887, I received the
third set&mdash;the four which illustrate the &ldquo;Pig-Tale.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So we went on, illustrating first one bit of the
story, and then another, without any idea of sequence.
And it was not till March, 1889, that, having calculated
the number of pages the story would occupy, I
decided on dividing it into <i>two</i> portions, and publishing
it half at a time. This necessitated the writing
of a <i>sort</i> of conclusion for the first Volume: and <i>most</i>
of my Readers, I fancy, regarded this as the <i>actual</i>
<span class="pb" id="Page_xiii">xiii</span>
conclusion, when that Volume appeared in December,
1889. At any rate, among all the letters I received
about it, there was only <i>one</i> which expressed <i>any</i> suspicion
that it was not a <i>final</i> conclusion. This letter
was from a child. She wrote &ldquo;we were so glad,
when we came to the end of the book, to find that
there was no ending-up, for that shows us that you
are going to write a sequel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It may interest some of my Readers to know the
<i>theory</i> on which this story is constructed. It is an
attempt to show what might <i>possibly</i> happen, supposing
that Fairies really existed; and that they were
sometimes visible to us, and we to them; and that
they were sometimes able to assume human form:
and supposing, also, that human beings might sometimes
become conscious of what goes on in the Fairy-world&mdash;by
actual transference of their immaterial
essence, such as we meet with in &lsquo;Esoteric Buddhism.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I have supposed a Human being to be capable of
various psychical states, with varying degrees of
consciousness, as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>(<i>a</i>) the ordinary state, with no consciousness of the
presence of Fairies;</p>
<p>(<i>b</i>) the &lsquo;eerie&rsquo; state, in which, while conscious of
actual surroundings, he is <i>also</i> conscious of the presence
of Fairies;</p>
<p>(<i>c</i>) a form of trance, in which, while <i>un</i>conscious
of actual surroundings, and apparently asleep, he (i.e.
his immaterial essence) migrates to other scenes, in
the actual world, or in Fairyland, and is conscious of
the presence of Fairies.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_xiv">xiv</div>
<p>I have also supposed a Fairy to be capable of migrating
from Fairyland into the actual world, and
of assuming, at pleasure, a Human form; and also
to be capable of various psychical states, viz.</p>
<p>(<i>a</i>) the ordinary state, with no consciousness of
the presence of Human beings;</p>
<p>(<i>b</i>) a sort of &lsquo;eerie&rsquo; state, in which he is conscious,
if in the actual world, of the presence of actual Human
beings; if in Fairyland, of the presence of the immaterial
essences of Human beings.</p>
<p>I will here tabulate the passages, in both Volumes, where abnormal states occur.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_xv">xv</div>
<p>In the Preface to Vol. I., at p. <a class="x" href="../../48630/48630-h/48630-h.htm#Page_x">x</a>., I gave an account
of the <i>origination</i> of some of the ideas embodied in
the book. A few more such details may perhaps interest
my Readers:&mdash;</p>
<p>I. <a class="x" href="../../48630/48630-h/48630-h.htm#Page_203">p. 203</a>. The very peculiar use, here made of a
dead mouse, comes from real life. I once found two
very small boys, in a garden, playing a microscopic
game of &lsquo;Single-Wicket.&rsquo; The bat was, I think, about
the size of a table-spoon; and the utmost distance
attained by the ball, in its most daring flights, was
some 4 or 5 yards. The <i>exact</i> length was of course a
matter of <i>supreme</i> importance; and it was always
carefully measured out (the batsman and the bowler
amicably sharing the toil) with a dead mouse!</p>
<p>I. <a class="x" href="../../48630/48630-h/48630-h.htm#Page_259">p. 259</a>. The two quasi-mathematical Axioms,
quoted by Arthur at p. 259 of Vol. I., (&ldquo;Things that
are greater than the same are greater than one
another,&rdquo; and &ldquo;All angles are equal&rdquo;) were actually
enunciated, in all seriousness, by undergraduates at a
University situated not 100 miles from Ely.</p>
<p>II. <a href="#Page_10">p. 10</a>. Bruno&rsquo;s remark (&ldquo;I can, if I like, &amp;c.&rdquo;)
was actually made by a little boy.</p>
<p>II. <a href="#Page_12">p. 12</a>. So also was his remark (&ldquo;I know what
it <i>doesn&rsquo;t</i> spell.&rdquo;) And his remark (&ldquo;I just twiddled
my eyes, &amp;c.&rdquo;) I heard from the lips of a little girl,
who had just solved a puzzle I had set her.</p>
<p>II. <a href="#Page_57">p. 57</a>. Bruno&rsquo;s soliloquy (&ldquo;For its father, &amp;c.&rdquo;)
was actually spoken by a little girl, looking out of
the window of a railway-carriage.</p>
<p>II. <a href="#Page_138">p. 138</a>. The remark, made by a guest at the
dinner-party, when asking for a dish of fruit (&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
<span class="pb" id="Page_xvi">xvi</span>
been wishing for them, &amp;c.&rdquo;) I heard made by the
great Poet-Laureate, whose loss the whole reading-world
has so lately had to deplore.</p>
<p>II. <a href="#Page_163">p. 163</a>. Bruno&rsquo;s speech, on the subject of the
age of &lsquo;Mein Herr,&rsquo; embodies the reply of a little
girl to the question &ldquo;Is your grandmother an <i>old</i>
lady?&rdquo; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know if she&rsquo;s an <i>old</i> lady,&rdquo; said this
cautious young person; &ldquo;she&rsquo;s <i>eighty-three</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>II. <a href="#Page_203">p. 203</a>. The speech about &lsquo;Obstruction&rsquo; is no
mere creature of my imagination! It is copied <i>verbatim</i>
from the columns of the Standard, and was
spoken by Sir William Harcourt, who was, at the
time, a member of the &lsquo;Opposition,&rsquo; at the &lsquo;National
Liberal Club,&rsquo; on July the 16th, 1890.</p>
<p>II. <a href="#Page_329">p. 329</a>. The Professor&rsquo;s remark, about a dog&rsquo;s
tail, that &ldquo;it doesn&rsquo;t bite at <i>that</i> end,&rdquo; was actually
made by a child, when warned of the danger he was
incurring by pulling the dog&rsquo;s tail.</p>
<p>II. <a href="#Page_374">p. 374</a>. The dialogue between Sylvie and Bruno,
which occupies lines 6 to 15, is a <i>verbatim</i> report
(merely substituting &ldquo;cake&rdquo; for &ldquo;penny&rdquo;) of a dialogue
overheard between two children.</p>
<p class="tb">One story in this Volume&mdash;&lsquo;Bruno&rsquo;s Picnic&rsquo;&mdash;I
can vouch for as suitable for telling to children,
having tested it again and again; and, whether my
audience has been a dozen little girls in a village-school,
or some thirty or forty in a London drawing-room,
or a hundred in a High School, I have always
found them earnestly attentive, and keenly appreciative
of such fun as the story supplied.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_xvii">xvii</div>
<p>May I take this opportunity of calling attention to
what I flatter myself was a successful piece of name-coining,
at <a class="x" href="../../48630/48630-h/48630-h.htm#Page_42">p. 42</a> of Vol. I. Does not the name
&lsquo;Sibimet&rsquo; fairly embody the character of the Sub-Warden?
The gentle Reader has no doubt observed
what a singularly useless article in a house a brazen
trumpet is, if you simply leave it lying about, and
never blow it!</p>
<p>Readers of the first Volume, who have amused
themselves by trying to solve the two puzzles propounded
at pp. <a class="x" href="../../48630/48630-h/48630-h.htm#Page_xi">xi</a>., <a class="x" href="../../48630/48630-h/48630-h.htm#Page_xii">xii</a>. of the Preface, may perhaps
like to exercise their ingenuity in discovering which

<p>I will publish the answer to this puzzle in the
Preface to a little book of &ldquo;Original Games and
Puzzles,&rdquo; now in course of preparation.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_xviii">xviii</div>
<p>I have reserved, for the last, one or two rather more
serious topics.</p>
<p class="tb">I had intended, in this Preface, to discuss more
fully, than I had done in the previous Volume, the
&lsquo;Morality of Sport&rsquo;, with special reference to letters
I have received from lovers of Sport, in which they
point out the many great advantages which men get
from it, and try to prove that the suffering, which it
inflicts on animals, is too trivial to be regarded.</p>
<p>But, when I came to think the subject out, and to
arrange the whole of the arguments &lsquo;pro&rsquo; and &lsquo;con&rsquo;,
I found it much too large for treatment here. Some
day, I hope to publish an essay on this subject. At
present, I will content myself with stating the net
result I have arrived at.</p>
<p>It is, that God has given to Man an absolute right
to take the <i>lives</i> of other animals, for <i>any</i> reasonable
cause, such as the supply of food: but that He has
<i>not</i> given to Man the right to inflict <i>pain</i>, unless
when <i>necessary</i>: that mere pleasure, or advantage,
does not constitute such a necessity: and, consequently,
that pain, inflicted for the purposes of
<i>Sport</i>, is cruel, and therefore wrong. But I find it a
far more complex question than I had supposed;
and that the &lsquo;case&rsquo;, on the side of the Sportsman, is
a much stronger one than I had supposed. So, for
the present, I say no more about it.</p>
<p class="tb">Objections have been raised to the severe language
I have put into the mouth of &lsquo;Arthur&rsquo;, at p. <a class="x" href="../../48630/48630-h/48630-h.htm#Page_277">277</a>, on
<span class="pb" id="Page_xix">xix</span>
the subject of &lsquo;Sermons,&rsquo; and at pp. <a class="x" href="../../48630/48630-h/48630-h.htm#Page_273">273</a>, <a class="x" href="../../48630/48630-h/48630-h.htm#Page_274">274</a>, on the
subjects of Choral Services and &lsquo;Choristers.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I have already protested against the assumption
that I am ready to endorse the opinions of characters
in my story. But, in these two instances, I admit
that I am much in sympathy with &lsquo;Arthur.&rsquo; In my
opinion, far too many sermons are expected from our
preachers; and, as a consequence, a great many are
preached, which are not worth listening to; and, as a
consequence of <i>that</i>, we are very apt <i>not</i> to listen.
The reader of this paragraph probably heard a sermon
last Sunday morning? Well, let him, if he can, name
the text, and state how the preacher treated it!</p>
<p>Then, as to &lsquo;Choristers,&rsquo; and all the other accessories&mdash;of
music, vestments, processions, &amp;c.,&mdash;which
have come, along with them, into fashion&mdash;while freely
admitting that the &lsquo;Ritual&rsquo; movement was sorely
needed, and that it has effected a vast improvement
in our Church-Services, which had become dead and
dry to the last degree, I hold that, like many other
desirable movements, it has gone too far in the opposite
direction, and has introduced many new dangers.</p>
<p>For the Congregation this new movement involves
the danger of learning to think that the Services are
done <i>for</i> them; and that their bodily <i>presence</i> is all
they need contribute. And, for Clergy and Congregation
alike, it involves the danger of regarding
these elaborate Services as <i>ends in themselves</i>, and
of forgetting that they are simply <i>means</i>, and the
very hollowest of mockeries, unless they bear fruit in
our <i>lives</i>.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_xx">xx</div>
<p>For the Choristers it seems to involve the danger
of self-conceit, as described at p. <a class="x" href="../../48630/48630-h/48630-h.htm#Page_274">274</a>, the
danger of regarding those parts of the Service, where
their help is not required, as not worth attending to,
the danger of coming to regard the Service as a mere
outward form&mdash;a series of postures to be assumed,
and of words to be said or sung, while the <i>thoughts</i>
are elsewhere&mdash;and the danger of &lsquo;familiarity&rsquo;
breeding &lsquo;contempt&rsquo; for sacred things.</p>
<p>Let me illustrate these last two forms of danger,
from my own experience. Not long ago, I attended
a Cathedral-Service, and was placed immediately
behind a row of men, members of the Choir; and I
could not help noticing that they treated the <i>Lessons</i>
as a part of the Service to which they needed not to
give <i>any</i> attention, and as affording them a convenient
opportunity for arranging music-books, &amp;c., &amp;c. Also
I have frequently seen a row of little choristers, after
marching in procession to their places, kneel down, as
if about to pray, and rise from their knees after a
minute spent in looking about them, it being but too
evident that the attitude was a mere mockery. Surely
it is very dangerous, for these children, to thus accustom
them to <i>pretend</i> to pray? As an instance of
irreverent treatment of holy things, I will mention a
custom, which no doubt many of my readers have
noticed in Churches where the Clergy and Choir enter
in procession, viz. that, at the end of the private devotions,
which are carried on in the vestry, and which
are of course inaudible to the Congregation, the final
<span class="pb" id="Page_xxi">xxi</span>
&ldquo;Amen&rdquo; is <i>shouted</i>, loud enough to be heard all
through the Church. This serves as a signal, to the
Congregation, to prepare to rise when the procession
appears: and it admits of no dispute that it is for this
purpose that it is thus shouted. When we remember
to Whom that &ldquo;Amen&rdquo; is <i>really</i> addressed, and consider
that it is here <i>used</i> for the same purpose as one
of the Church-bells, we must surely admit that it is a
piece of gross irreverence? To <i>me</i> it is much as if
I were to see a Bible used as a footstool.</p>
<p>As an instance of the dangers, for the Clergy
themselves, introduced by this new movement, let
me mention the fact that, according to <i>my</i> experience,
Clergymen of this school are <i>specially</i> apt to
retail comic anecdotes, in which the most sacred
names and words&mdash;sometimes actual texts from
the Bible&mdash;are used as themes for jesting. Many
such things are repeated as having been originally
said by <i>children</i>, whose utter ignorance of evil must
no doubt acquit <i>them</i>, in the sight of God, of all
blame; but it must be otherwise for those who
<i>consciously</i> use such innocent utterances as material
for their unholy mirth.</p>
<p>Let me add, however, <i>most</i> earnestly, that I fully
believe that this profanity is, in many cases, <i>un</i>conscious:
the &lsquo;environment&rsquo; (as I have tried to explain
at <a href="#Page_123">p. 123</a>) makes all the difference between man and
man; and I rejoice to think that many of these profane
stories&mdash;which <i>I</i> find so painful to listen to,
and should feel it a sin to repeat&mdash;give to <i>their</i> ears
no pain, and to <i>their</i> consciences no shock; and that
<span class="pb" id="Page_xxii">xxii</span>
<i>they</i> can utter, not less sincerely than myself, the
two prayers, &ldquo;<i>Hallowed be Thy Name</i>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<i>from
hardness of heart, and contempt of Thy Word and
Commandment, Good Lord, deliver us!</i>&rdquo; To which
I would desire to add, for their sake and for my own,
Keble&rsquo;s beautiful petition, &ldquo;<i>help us, this and every day,
To live more nearly as we pray!</i>&rdquo; It is, in fact, for
its <i>consequences</i>&mdash;for the grave dangers, both to speaker
and to hearer, which it involves&mdash;rather than for what
it is <i>in itself</i>, that I mourn over this clerical habit of
profanity in social talk. To the <i>believing</i> hearer it
brings the danger of loss of reverence for holy things,
by the mere act of listening to, and enjoying, such
jests; and also the temptation to retail them for the
amusement of others. To the <i>unbelieving</i> hearer it
brings a welcome confirmation of his theory that
religion is a fable, in the spectacle of its accredited
champions thus betraying their trust. And to the
speaker himself it must surely bring the danger of
<i>loss of faith</i>. For surely such jests, if uttered with
no consciousness of harm, must necessarily be also
uttered with no consciousness, at the moment, of the
<i>reality</i> of God, as a <i>living being</i>, who hears all we say.
And he, who allows himself the habit of thus uttering
holy words, with no thought of their meaning, is but
too likely to find that, for him, God has become a
myth, and heaven a poetic fancy&mdash;that, for him, the
light of life is gone, and that he is at heart an atheist,
lost in &ldquo;<i>a darkness that may be felt</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There is, I fear, at the present time, an increasing
tendency to irreverent treatment of the name of God
<span class="pb" id="Page_xxiii">xxiii</span>
and of subjects connected with religion. Some of
our theatres are helping this downward movement by
the gross caricatures of clergymen which they put
upon the stage: some of our clergy are themselves
helping it, by showing that they can lay aside the
spirit of reverence, along with their surplices, and can
treat as jests, when <i>outside</i> their churches, names and
things to which they pay an almost superstitious
veneration when <i>inside</i>: the &ldquo;Salvation Army&rdquo; has,
I fear, with the best intentions, done much to help it,
by the coarse familiarity with which they treat holy
things: and surely every one, who desires to <i>live</i> in
the spirit of the prayer &ldquo;<i>Hallowed be thy Name</i>,&rdquo;
ought to do what he can, however little that may be,
to check it. So I have gladly taken this unique
opportunity, however unfit the topic may seem for the
Preface to a book of this kind, to express some
thoughts which have weighed on my mind for a long
time. I did not expect, when I wrote the Preface to
Vol. I, that it would be read to any appreciable extent:
but I rejoice to believe, from evidence that has
reached me, that it <i>has</i> been read by many, and to
hope that this Preface will also be so: and I think
that, among them, some will be found ready to
sympathise with the views I have put forwards, and
ready to help, with their prayers and their example,
the revival, in Society, of the waning spirit of
reverence.</p>

<p>During the next month or two my solitary
town-life seemed, by contrast, unusually dull
and tedious. I missed the pleasant friends I
had left behind at Elveston&mdash;the genial interchange
of thought&mdash;the sympathy which gave
to one&rsquo;s ideas a new and vivid reality: but,
perhaps more than all, I missed the companionship
of the two Fairies&mdash;or Dream-Children,
for I had not yet solved the problem as to
who or what they were&mdash;whose sweet playfulness
had shed a magic radiance over my life.</p>
<p>In office-hours&mdash;which I suppose reduce
most men to the mental condition of a coffee-mill
<span class="pb" id="Page_2">2</span>
or a mangle&mdash;time sped along much as
usual: it was in the pauses of life, the desolate
hours when books and newspapers palled on
the sated appetite, and when, thrown back
upon one&rsquo;s own dreary musings, one strove&mdash;all
in vain&mdash;to people the vacant air with the
dear faces of absent friends, that the real bitterness
of solitude made itself felt.</p>
<p>One evening, feeling my life a little more
wearisome than usual, I strolled down to my
Club, not so much with the hope of meeting
any friend there, for London was now &lsquo;out of
town,&rsquo; as with the feeling that here, at least,
I should hear &lsquo;sweet words of human speech,&rsquo;
and come into contact with human thought.</p>
<p>However, almost the first face I saw there
<i>was</i> that of a friend. Eric Lindon was lounging,
with rather a &lsquo;bored&rsquo; expression of face,
over a newspaper; and we fell into conversation
with a mutual satisfaction which neither
of us tried to conceal.</p>
<p>After a while I ventured to introduce what
was just then the main subject of my thoughts.
&ldquo;And so the Doctor&rdquo; (a name we had adopted
by a tacit agreement, as a convenient compromise
<span class="pb" id="Page_3">3</span>
between the formality of &lsquo;Doctor
Forester&rsquo; and the intimacy&mdash;to which Eric
Lindon hardly seemed entitled&mdash;of &lsquo;Arthur&rsquo;)
&ldquo;has gone abroad by this time, I suppose?
Can you give me his present address?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is still at Elveston&mdash;I believe,&rdquo; was
the reply. &ldquo;But I have not been there since
I last met you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I did not know which part of this intelligence
to wonder at most. &ldquo;And might I ask&mdash;if
it isn&rsquo;t taking too much of a liberty&mdash;when
your wedding-bells are to&mdash;or perhaps they
<i>have</i> rung, already?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Eric, in a steady voice, which
betrayed scarcely a trace of emotion: &ldquo;<i>that</i> engagement
is at an end. I am still &lsquo;Benedick
the <i>un</i>married man.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>After this, the thick-coming fancies&mdash;all
radiant with new possibilities of happiness for
Arthur&mdash;were far too bewildering to admit of
any further conversation, and I was only too
glad to avail myself of the first decent excuse,
that offered itself, for retiring into silence.</p>
<p>The next day I wrote to Arthur, with as
much of a reprimand for his long silence as I
<span class="pb" id="Page_4">4</span>
could bring myself to put into words, begging
him to tell me how the world went with him.</p>
<p>Needs must that three or four days&mdash;possibly
more&mdash;should elapse before I could
receive his reply; and never had I known days
drag their slow length along with a more tedious
indolence.</p>
<p>To while away the time, I strolled, one afternoon,
into Kensington Gardens, and, wandering
aimlessly along any path that presented itself,
I soon became aware that I had somehow
strayed into one that was wholly new to me.
Still, my elfish experiences seemed to have so
completely faded out of my life that nothing
was further from my thoughts than the idea of
again meeting my fairy-friends, when I chanced
to notice a small creature, moving among the
grass that fringed the path, that did not seem
to be an insect, or a frog, or any other living
thing that I could think of. Cautiously kneeling
down, and making an <i>ex tempore</i> cage of
my two hands, I imprisoned the little wanderer,
and felt a sudden thrill of surprise and delight
on discovering that my prisoner was no other
than <i>Bruno</i> himself!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_5">5</div>
<p>Bruno took the matter <i>very</i> coolly, and, when
I had replaced him on the ground, where he
would be within easy conversational distance,
he began talking, just as if it were only a few
minutes since last we had met.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doos oo know what the <i>Rule</i> is,&rdquo; he enquired,
&ldquo;when oo catches a Fairy, withouten
its having tolded oo where it was?&rdquo; (Bruno&rsquo;s
notions of English Grammar had certainly <i>not</i>
improved since our last meeting.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know there was any
Rule about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I <i>think</i> oo&rsquo;ve got a right to <i>eat</i> me,&rdquo; said
the little fellow, looking up into my face with a
winning smile. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m not pruffickly sure.
Oo&rsquo;d better not do it wizout asking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It did indeed seem reasonable not to take so
irrevocable a step as <i>that</i>, without due enquiry.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll certainly <i>ask</i> about it, first,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Besides,
I don&rsquo;t know yet whether you would be
<i>worth</i> eating!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess I&rsquo;m <i>deliciously</i> good to eat,&rdquo; Bruno
remarked in a satisfied tone, as if it were something
to be rather proud of.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what are you doing here, Bruno?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">6</div>
<p>&ldquo;<i>That&rsquo;s</i> not my name!&rdquo; said my cunning
little friend. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t oo know my name&rsquo;s &lsquo;Oh
Bruno!&rsquo;? That&rsquo;s what Sylvie always calls me,
when I says mine lessons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well then, what are you doing here, oh
Bruno?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doing mine lessons, a-course!&rdquo; With
that roguish twinkle in his eye, that always
came when he knew he was talking nonsense.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, <i>that&rsquo;s</i> the way you do your lessons,
is it? And do you remember them well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Always can &rsquo;member <i>mine</i> lessons,&rdquo; said
Bruno. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s <i>Sylvie&rsquo;s</i> lessons that&rsquo;s so <i>dreffully</i>
hard to &rsquo;member!&rdquo; He frowned, as if in
agonies of thought, and tapped his forehead
with his knuckles. &ldquo;I <i>ca&rsquo;n&rsquo;t</i> think enough to
understand them!&rdquo; he said despairingly. &ldquo;It
wants <i>double</i> thinking, I believe!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But where&rsquo;s Sylvie gone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just what <i>I</i> want to know!&rdquo; said
Bruno disconsolately. &ldquo;What ever&rsquo;s the good
of setting me lessons, when she isn&rsquo;t here to
&rsquo;splain the hard bits?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>I&rsquo;ll</i> find her for you!&rdquo; I volunteered; and,
getting up, I wandered round the tree under
<span class="pb" id="Page_7">7</span>
whose shade I had been reclining, looking on
all sides for Sylvie. In another minute I <i>again</i>
noticed some strange thing moving among the
grass, and, kneeling down, was immediately
confronted with Sylvie&rsquo;s innocent face, lighted
up with a joyful surprise at seeing me, and was
accosted, in the sweet voice I knew so well,
with what seemed to be the <i>end</i> of a sentence
whose beginning I had failed to catch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&mdash;and I think he ought to have <i>finished</i>
them by this time. So I&rsquo;m going back to him.
Will you come too? It&rsquo;s only just round at
the other side of this tree.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was but a few steps for <i>me</i>; but it was a
great many for Sylvie; and I had to be very
careful to walk slowly, in order not to leave
the little creature so far behind as to lose
sight of her.</p>
<p>To find Bruno&rsquo;s <i>lessons</i> was easy enough:
they appeared to be neatly written out on large
smooth ivy-leaves, which were scattered in some
confusion over a little patch of ground where
the grass had been worn away; but the pale
student, who ought by rights to have been
bending over them, was nowhere to be seen:
<span class="pb" id="Page_8">8</span>
we looked in all directions, for some time, in
vain; but at last Sylvie&rsquo;s sharp eyes detected
him, swinging on a tendril of ivy, and Sylvie&rsquo;s
stern voice commanded his instant return to
<i>terra firma</i> and to the business of Life.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">9</div>
<p>&ldquo;Pleasure first and business afterwards&rdquo;
seemed to be the motto of these tiny folk, so
many hugs and kisses had to be interchanged
before anything else could be done.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Bruno,&rdquo; Sylvie said reproachfully,
&ldquo;didn&rsquo;t I tell you you were to go on with your
lessons, unless you heard to the contrary?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I <i>did</i> heard to the contrary!&rdquo; Bruno
insisted, with a mischievous twinkle in his eye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>What</i> did you hear, you wicked boy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It were a sort of noise in the air,&rdquo; said
Bruno: &ldquo;a sort of a scrambling noise. Didn&rsquo;t
<i>oo</i> hear it, Mister Sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, anyhow, you needn&rsquo;t go to <i>sleep</i> over
them, you lazy-lazy!&rdquo; For Bruno had curled
himself up, on the largest &lsquo;lesson,&rsquo; and was
arranging another as a pillow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I <i>wasn&rsquo;t</i> asleep!&rdquo; said Bruno, in a deeply-injured
tone. &ldquo;When I shuts mine eyes, it&rsquo;s
to show that I&rsquo;m <i>awake</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, how much have you learned, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve learned a little tiny bit,&rdquo; said Bruno,
modestly, being evidently afraid of overstating
his achievement. &ldquo;<i>Ca&rsquo;n&rsquo;t</i> learn no more!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh Bruno! You know you <i>can</i>, if you like.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">10</div>
<p>&ldquo;Course I can, if I <i>like</i>,&rdquo; the pale student
replied; &ldquo;but I ca&rsquo;n&rsquo;t if I <i>don&rsquo;t</i> like!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sylvie had a way&mdash;which I could not too
highly admire&mdash;of evading Bruno&rsquo;s logical
perplexities by suddenly striking into a new
line of thought; and this masterly stratagem
she now adopted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I must say <i>one</i> thing&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did oo know, Mister Sir,&rdquo; Bruno thoughtfully
remarked, &ldquo;that Sylvie ca&rsquo;n&rsquo;t count?
Whenever she says &lsquo;I must say <i>one</i> thing,&rsquo; I
<i>know</i> quite well she&rsquo;ll say <i>two</i> things! And
she always doos.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two heads are better than one, Bruno,&rdquo; I
said, but with no very distinct idea as to what
I meant by it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t mind having two <i>heads</i>,&rdquo; Bruno
said softly to himself: &ldquo;one head to eat mine
dinner, and one head to argue wiz Sylvie&mdash;doos
oo think oo&rsquo;d look prettier if oo&rsquo;d got
<i>two</i> heads, Mister Sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The case did not, I assured him, admit of a
doubt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The reason why Sylvie&rsquo;s so cross&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
Bruno went on very seriously, almost sadly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">11</div>
<p>Sylvie&rsquo;s eyes grew large and round with
surprise at this new line of enquiry&mdash;her rosy
face being perfectly radiant with good humour.
But she said nothing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t it be better to tell me after the
lessons are over?&rdquo; I suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; Bruno said with a resigned air:
&ldquo;only she wo&rsquo;n&rsquo;t be cross then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s only three lessons to do,&rdquo; said Sylvie.
&ldquo;Spelling, and Geography, and Singing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not <i>Arithmetic</i>?&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, he hasn&rsquo;t a head for Arithmetic&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Course I haven&rsquo;t!&rdquo; said Bruno. &ldquo;Mine
head&rsquo;s for <i>hair</i>. I haven&rsquo;t got a <i>lot</i> of heads!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&mdash;and he ca&rsquo;n&rsquo;t learn his Multiplication-table&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like <i>History</i> ever so much better,&rdquo; Bruno
remarked. &ldquo;Oo has to <i>repeat</i> that Muddlecome
table&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, and you have to repeat&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, oo hasn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; Bruno interrupted. &ldquo;History
repeats itself. The Professor said so!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sylvie was arranging some letters on a
board&mdash;&mdash;E&mdash;V&mdash;I&mdash;L. &ldquo;Now, Bruno,&rdquo; she
said, &ldquo;what does <i>that</i> spell?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<p>Bruno looked at it, in solemn silence, for a
minute. &ldquo;I knows what it <i>doosn&rsquo;t</i> spell!&rdquo; he
said at last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s no good,&rdquo; said Sylvie. &ldquo;What <i>does</i>
it spell?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bruno took another look at the mysterious
letters. &ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s &lsquo;LIVE,&rsquo; backwards!&rdquo; he
exclaimed. (I thought it was, indeed.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;How <i>did</i> you manage to see that?&rdquo; said
Sylvie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I just twiddled my eyes,&rdquo; said Bruno,
&ldquo;and then I saw it directly. Now may I
sing the King-fisher Song?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Geography next,&rdquo; said Sylvie. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you
know the Rules?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thinks there oughtn&rsquo;t to be such a lot of
Rules, Sylvie! I thinks&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, there <i>ought</i> to be such a lot of Rules,
you wicked, wicked boy! And how dare you
<i>think</i> at all about it? And shut up that
mouth directly!&rdquo;</p>
<p>So, as &lsquo;that mouth&rsquo; didn&rsquo;t seem inclined to
shut up of itself, Sylvie shut it for him&mdash;with
both hands&mdash;and sealed it with a kiss, just as
you would fasten up a letter.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now that Bruno is fastened up from
talking,&rdquo; she went on, turning to me, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
show you the Map he does his lessons on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And there it was, a large Map of the World,
spread out on the ground. It was so large that
Bruno had to crawl about on it, to point out the
places named in the &lsquo;King-fisher Lesson.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When a King-fisher sees a Lady-bird flying
away, he says &lsquo;<i>Ceylon</i>, if you <i>Candia</i>!&rsquo; And
when he catches it, he says &lsquo;Come to <i>Media</i>!
And if you&rsquo;re <i>Hungary</i> or thirsty, I&rsquo;ll give you
some <i>Nubia</i>!&rsquo; When he takes it in his claws,
he says &lsquo;<i>Europe!</i>&rsquo; When he puts it into his
beak, he says &lsquo;<i>India!</i>&rsquo; When he&rsquo;s swallowed
it, he says &lsquo;<i>Eton!</i>&rsquo; That&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s <i>quite</i> perfect,&rdquo; said Sylvie. &ldquo;Now
you may sing the King-fisher Song.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will <i>oo</i> sing the chorus?&rdquo; Bruno said to me.</p>
<p>I was just beginning to say &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I
don&rsquo;t know the <i>words</i>,&rdquo; when Sylvie silently
turned the map over, and I found the words
were all written on the back. In one respect
it was a <i>very</i> peculiar song: the chorus to each
verse came in the <i>middle</i>, instead of at the <i>end</i>
of it. However, the tune was so easy that I
<span class="pb" id="Page_14">14</span>
soon picked it up, and managed the chorus as
well, perhaps, as it is possible for <i>one</i> person to
manage such a thing. It was in vain that I
signed to Sylvie to help me: she only smiled
sweetly and shook her head.</p>
<div class="verse">

<p class="t0"><span class="norm"><b>Sing Beans, sing Bones, sing Butterflies!</b></span></p>
<p class="t">&lsquo;Find me my match,&rsquo; he said,</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<p>&ldquo;So he went away,&rdquo; Bruno added as a kind
of postscript, when the last note of the song
had died away. &ldquo;Just like he always did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, my <i>dear</i> Bruno!&rdquo; Sylvie exclaimed,
with her hands over her ears. &ldquo;You shouldn&rsquo;t
say &lsquo;like&rsquo;: you should say &lsquo;<i>what</i>.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>To which Bruno replied, doggedly, &ldquo;I only
says &lsquo;what!&rsquo; when oo doosn&rsquo;t speak loud, so
as I can hear oo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did he go to?&rdquo; I asked, hoping to
prevent an argument.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He went more far than he&rsquo;d never been
before,&rdquo; said Bruno.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You should never say &lsquo;more far,&rsquo;&rdquo; Sylvie
corrected him: &ldquo;you should say &lsquo;<i>farther</i>.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then <i>oo</i> shouldn&rsquo;t say &lsquo;more broth,&rsquo; when
we&rsquo;re at dinner,&rdquo; Bruno retorted: &ldquo;oo should
say &lsquo;<i>brother</i>&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This time Sylvie evaded an argument by
turning away, and beginning to roll up the
Map. &ldquo;Lessons are over!&rdquo; she proclaimed
in her sweetest tones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And has there been no <i>crying</i> over them?&rdquo;
I enquired. &ldquo;Little boys <i>always</i> cry over their
lessons, don&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<p>&ldquo;I never cries after twelve o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; said
Bruno: &ldquo;&rsquo;cause then it&rsquo;s getting so near to
dinner-time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sometimes, in the morning,&rdquo; Sylvie said in
a low voice; &ldquo;when it&rsquo;s Geography-day, and
when he&rsquo;s been disobe&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>What</i> a fellow you are to talk, Sylvie!&rdquo;
Bruno hastily interposed. &ldquo;Doos oo think
the world was <i>made</i> for oo to talk in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, where would you <i>have</i> me talk,
then?&rdquo; Sylvie said, evidently quite ready for
an argument.</p>
<p>But Bruno answered resolutely. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not
going to argue about it, &rsquo;cause it&rsquo;s getting late,
and there wo&rsquo;n&rsquo;t be time&mdash;but oo&rsquo;s as &rsquo;ong as
ever oo can be!&rdquo; And he rubbed the back of
his hand across his eyes, in which tears were
beginning to glitter.</p>
<p><i>Sylvie&rsquo;s</i> eyes filled with tears in a moment.
&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean it, Bruno, <i>darling</i>!&rdquo; she whispered;
and the rest of the argument was lost
&lsquo;amid the tangles of Ne&aelig;ra&rsquo;s hair,&rsquo; while the
two disputants hugged and kissed each other.</p>
<p>But this new form of argument was brought
to a sudden end by a flash of lightning, which
<span class="pb" id="Page_18">18</span>
was closely followed by a peal of thunder, and
by a torrent of rain-drops, which came hissing
and spitting, almost like live creatures, through
the leaves of the tree that sheltered us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s raining cats and dogs!&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And all the <i>dogs</i> has come down <i>first</i>,&rdquo;
said Bruno: &ldquo;there&rsquo;s nothing but <i>cats</i> coming
down now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In another minute the pattering ceased, as
suddenly as it had begun. I stepped out from
under the tree, and found that the storm was
over; but I looked in vain, on my return, for
my tiny companions. They had vanished with
the storm, and there was nothing for it but to
make the best of my way home.</p>
<p>On the table lay, awaiting my return, an
envelope of that peculiar yellow tint which
always announces a telegram, and which must
be, in the memories of so many of us, inseparably
linked with some great and sudden
sorrow&mdash;something that has cast a shadow,
never in this world to be wholly lifted off, on
the brightness of Life. No doubt it has <i>also</i>
heralded&mdash;for many of us&mdash;some sudden
news of joy; but this, I think, is less common:
<span class="pb" id="Page_19">19</span>
human life seems, on the whole, to contain
more of sorrow than of joy. And yet the
world goes on. Who knows why?</p>
<p>This time, however, there was no shock of
sorrow to be faced: in fact, the few words it
contained (&ldquo;Could not bring myself to write.
Come soon. Always welcome. A letter follows
this. Arthur.&rdquo;) seemed so like Arthur himself
speaking, that it gave me quite a thrill of
pleasure, and I at once began the preparations
needed for the journey.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<h2 id="c2">CHAPTER II.
<br /><span class="small">LOVE&rsquo;S CURFEW.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Fayfield Junction! Change for Elveston!&rdquo;</p>
<p>What subtle memory could there be, linked
to these commonplace words, that caused such
a flood of happy thoughts to fill my brain? I
dismounted from the carriage in a state of
joyful excitement for which I could not at first
account. True, I had taken this very journey,
and at the same hour of the day, six months
ago; but many things had happened since
then, and an old man&rsquo;s memory has but a
slender hold on recent events: I sought &lsquo;the
missing link&rsquo; in vain. Suddenly I caught
sight of a bench&mdash;the only one provided on
<span class="pb" id="Page_21">21</span>
the cheerless platform&mdash;with a lady seated
on it, and the whole forgotten scene flashed
upon me as vividly as if it were happening
over again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I thought. &ldquo;This bare platform is,
for me, rich with the memory of a dear friend!
She was sitting on that very bench, and invited
me to share it, with some quotation from
Shakespeare&mdash;I forget what. I&rsquo;ll try the
Earl&rsquo;s plan for the Dramatisation of Life, and
fancy that figure to be Lady Muriel; and I
won&rsquo;t undeceive myself too soon!&rdquo;</p>
<p>So I strolled along the platform, resolutely
&lsquo;making-believe&rsquo; (as children say) that the
casual passenger, seated on that bench, was
the Lady Muriel I remembered so well. She
was facing away from me, which aided the
elaborate cheatery I was practising on myself:
but, though I was careful, in passing the spot,
to look the other way, in order to prolong the
pleasant illusion, it was inevitable that, when I
turned to walk back again, I should see who
it was. It was Lady Muriel herself!</p>

<p class="center small">&lsquo;SPEND IT ALL FOR MINNIE&rsquo;</p>
</div>
<p>The whole scene now returned vividly to
my memory; and, to make this repetition of
it stranger still, there was the same old man,
whom I remembered seeing so roughly ordered
off, by the Station-Master, to make room for
his titled passenger. The same, but &lsquo;with a
difference&rsquo;: no longer tottering feebly along
the platform, but actually seated at Lady
Muriel&rsquo;s side, and in conversation with her!
&ldquo;Yes, put it in your purse,&rdquo; she was saying,
&ldquo;and remember you&rsquo;re to spend it all for
<i>Minnie</i>. And mind you bring her something
nice, that&rsquo;ll do her real good! And give her
<span class="pb" id="Page_23">23</span>
my love!&rdquo; So intent was she on saying these
words, that, although the sound of my footstep
had made her lift her head and look at me,
she did not at first recognise me.</p>
<p>I raised my hat as I approached, and then
there flashed across her face a genuine look
of joy, which so exactly recalled the sweet face
of Sylvie, when last we met in Kensington
Gardens, that I felt quite bewildered.</p>
<p>Rather than disturb the poor old man at her
side, she rose from her seat, and joined me in
my walk up and down the platform, and for a
minute or two our conversation was as utterly
trivial and commonplace as if we were merely
two casual guests in a London drawing-room.
Each of us seemed to shrink, just at first,
from touching on the deeper interests which
linked our lives together.</p>
<p>The Elveston train had drawn up at the
platform, while we talked; and, in obedience
to the Station-Master&rsquo;s obsequious hint of
&ldquo;This way, my Lady! Time&rsquo;s up!&rdquo;, we were
making the best of our way towards the end
which contained the sole first-class carriage,
and were just passing the now-empty bench,
<span class="pb" id="Page_24">24</span>
when Lady Muriel noticed, lying on it, the
purse in which her gift had just been so
carefully bestowed, the owner of which, all
unconscious of his loss, was being helped into
a carriage at the other end of the train. She
pounced on it instantly. &ldquo;Poor old man!&rdquo;
she cried. &ldquo;He mustn&rsquo;t go off, and think
he&rsquo;s lost it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let <i>me</i> run with it! I can go quicker
than you!&rdquo; I said. But she was already
half-way down the platform, flying (&lsquo;running&rsquo;
is much too mundane a word for such fairy-like
motion) at a pace that left all possible
efforts of <i>mine</i> hopelessly in the rear.</p>
<p>She was back again before I had well completed
my audacious boast of speed in running,
and was saying, quite demurely, as we entered
our carriage, &ldquo;and you really think <i>you</i> could
have done it quicker?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No indeed!&rdquo; I replied. &ldquo;I plead &lsquo;Guilty&rsquo;
of gross exaggeration, and throw myself on the
mercy of the Court!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Court will overlook it&mdash;for this
once!&rdquo; Then her manner suddenly changed
from playfulness to an anxious gravity.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<p>&ldquo;You are not looking your best!&rdquo; she said
with an anxious glance. &ldquo;In fact, I think you
look <i>more</i> of an invalid than when you left us.
I very much doubt if London agrees with you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It <i>may</i> be the London air,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;or it
may be the hard work&mdash;or my rather lonely
life: anyhow, I&rsquo;ve <i>not</i> been feeling very well,
lately. But Elveston will soon set me up
again. Arthur&rsquo;s prescription&mdash;he&rsquo;s my doctor,
you know, and I heard from him this morning&mdash;is
&lsquo;plenty of ozone, and new milk, and
<i>pleasant society</i>&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pleasant society?&rdquo; said Lady Muriel, with
a pretty make-believe of considering the
question. &ldquo;Well, really I don&rsquo;t know where
we can find <i>that</i> for you! We have so few
neighbours. But new milk we <i>can</i> manage. Do
get it of my old friend Mrs. Hunter, up there,
on the hill-side. You may rely upon the
<i>quality</i>. And her little Bessie comes to school
every day, and passes your lodgings. So it
would be very easy to send it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll follow your advice, with pleasure,&rdquo; I
said; &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll go and arrange about it tomorrow.
I know Arthur will want a walk.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll find it quite an easy walk&mdash;under
three miles, I think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, now that we&rsquo;ve settled that point, let
me retort your own remark upon yourself. I
don&rsquo;t think <i>you&rsquo;re</i> looking quite your best!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I daresay not,&rdquo; she replied in a low voice;
and a sudden shadow seemed to overspread her
face. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had some troubles lately. It&rsquo;s a
matter about which I&rsquo;ve been long wishing to
consult you, but I couldn&rsquo;t easily write about
it. I&rsquo;m <i>so</i> glad to have this opportunity!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think,&rdquo; she began again, after a
minute&rsquo;s silence, and with a visible embarrassment
of manner most unusual in her, &ldquo;that
a promise, deliberately and solemnly given, is
<i>always</i> binding&mdash;except, of course, where its
fulfilment would involve some actual <i>sin</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ca&rsquo;n&rsquo;t think of any other exception at this
moment,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;That branch of casuistry
is usually, I believe, treated as a question of
truth and untruth&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely that <i>is</i> the principle?&rdquo; she eagerly
interrupted. &ldquo;I always thought the Bible-teaching
about it consisted of such texts as
&lsquo;<i>lie not one to another</i>&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<p>&ldquo;I have thought about that point,&rdquo; I replied;
&ldquo;and it seems to me that the essence of
<i>lying</i> is the intention of <i>deceiving</i>. If you give
a promise, fully <i>intending</i> to fulfil it, you are
certainly acting truthfully <i>then</i>; and, if you
afterwards break it, that does not involve
any <i>deception</i>. I cannot call it <i>untruthful</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another pause of silence ensued. Lady
Muriel&rsquo;s face was hard to read: she looked
pleased, I thought, but also puzzled; and I
felt curious to know whether her question
had, as I began to suspect, some bearing on
the breaking off of her engagement with
Captain (now Major) Lindon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have relieved me from a great fear,&rdquo;
she said; &ldquo;but the thing is of course <i>wrong</i>,
somehow. What texts would <i>you</i> quote, to
prove it wrong?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any that enforce the payment of <i>debts</i>.
If <i>A</i> promises something to <i>B</i>, <i>B</i> has a claim
upon <i>A</i>. And <i>A</i>&rsquo;s sin, if he breaks his
promise, seems to me more analogous to
<i>stealing</i> than to <i>lying</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a new way of looking at it&mdash;to me,&rdquo;
she said; &ldquo;but it seems a <i>true</i> way, also.
<span class="pb" id="Page_28">28</span>
However, I won&rsquo;t deal in generalities, with
an old friend like you! For we <i>are</i> old
friends, somehow. Do you know, I think we
<i>began</i> as old friends?&rdquo; she said with a playfulness
of tone that ill accorded with the tears
that glistened in her eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you very much for saying so,&rdquo; I
replied. &ldquo;I like to think of you as an <i>old</i>
friend,&rdquo; (&ldquo;&mdash;though you don&rsquo;t look it!&rdquo; would
have been the almost necessary sequence, with
any other lady; but she and I seemed to have
long passed out of the time when compliments,
or any such trivialities, were possible.)</p>
<p>Here the train paused at a station, where
two or three passengers entered the carriage;
so no more was said till we had reached our
journey&rsquo;s end.</p>
<p>On our arrival at Elveston, she readily
adopted my suggestion that we should walk
up together; so, as soon as our luggage had
been duly taken charge of&mdash;hers by the servant
who met her at the station, and mine by
one of the porters&mdash;we set out together along
the familiar lanes, now linked in my memory
with so many delightful associations. Lady
<span class="pb" id="Page_29">29</span>
Muriel at once recommenced the conversation
at the point where it had been interrupted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You knew of my engagement to my
cousin Eric. Did you also hear&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I interrupted, anxious to spare her
the pain of giving any details. &ldquo;I heard it
had all come to an end.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would like to tell you how it happened,&rdquo;
she said; &ldquo;as that is the very point I want
your advice about. I had long realised that
we were not in sympathy in religious belief.
His ideas of Christianity are very shadowy;
and even as to the existence of a God he lives
in a sort of dreamland. But it has not affected
his life! I feel sure, now, that the most absolute
Atheist <i>may</i> be leading, though walking
blindfold, a pure and noble life. And if you
knew half the good deeds&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; she broke off
suddenly, and turned away her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I entirely agree with you,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;And
have we not our Saviour&rsquo;s own promise that
such a life shall surely lead to the light?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know it,&rdquo; she said in a broken voice,
still keeping her head turned away. &ldquo;And so
I told him. He said he would believe, for <i>my</i>
<span class="pb" id="Page_30">30</span>
sake, if he could. And he wished, for <i>my</i> sake,
he could see things as I did. But that is all
wrong!&rdquo; she went on passionately. &ldquo;God
<i>cannot</i> approve such low motives as that!
Still it was not <i>I</i> that broke it off. I knew
he loved me; and I had <i>promised</i>; and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it was <i>he</i> that broke it off?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He released me unconditionally.&rdquo; She
faced me again now, having quite recovered
her usual calmness of manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then what difficulty remains?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is <i>this</i>, that I don&rsquo;t believe he did it of
his own free will. Now, supposing he did it
<i>against</i> his will, merely to satisfy my scruples,
would not his claim on me remain just as
strong as ever? And would not my promise
be as binding as ever? My father says
&lsquo;no&rsquo;; but I ca&rsquo;n&rsquo;t help fearing he is biased
by his love for me. And I&rsquo;ve asked no one
else. I have many friends&mdash;friends for the
bright sunny weather; not friends for the
clouds and storms of life; not <i>old</i> friends
like you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me think a little,&rdquo; I said: and for
some minutes we walked on in silence, while,
<span class="pb" id="Page_31">31</span>
pained to the heart at seeing the bitter trial
that had come upon this pure and gentle soul,
I strove in vain to see my way through the
tangled skein of conflicting motives.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If she loves him truly,&rdquo; (I seemed at last
to grasp the clue to the problem) &ldquo;is not <i>that</i>,
for her, the voice of God? May she not hope
that she is sent to him, even as Ananias was
sent to Saul in his blindness, that he may receive
his sight?&rdquo; Once more I seemed to
hear Arthur whispering &ldquo;<i>What knowest thou,
O wife, whether thou shalt save thy husband?</i>&rdquo;
and I broke the silence with the words &ldquo;If
you still love him truly&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do <i>not</i>!&rdquo; she hastily interrupted. &ldquo;At
least&mdash;not in <i>that</i> way. I <i>believe</i> I loved him
when I promised; but I was very young: it
is hard to know. But, whatever the feeling
was, it is dead <i>now</i>. The motive on <i>his</i> side
is Love: on <i>mine</i> it is&mdash;Duty!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again there was a long silence. The whole
skein of thought was tangled worse than ever.
This time <i>she</i> broke the silence. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t misunderstand
me!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;When I said my
heart was not <i>his</i>, I did not mean it was any
<span class="pb" id="Page_32">32</span>
one else&rsquo;s! At present I feel bound to <i>him</i>;
and, till I know I am absolutely free, in the
sight of God, to love any other than him,
I&rsquo;ll never even <i>think</i> of any one else&mdash;in
<i>that</i> way, I mean. I would die sooner!&rdquo; I
had never imagined my gentle friend capable
of such passionate utterances.</p>
<p>I ventured on no further remark until we
had nearly arrived at the Hall-gate; but, the
longer I reflected, the clearer it became
to me that no call of Duty demanded the
sacrifice&mdash;possibly of the happiness of a life&mdash;which
she seemed ready to make. I tried
to make this clear to <i>her</i> also, adding some
warnings on the dangers that surely awaited
a union in which mutual love was wanting.
&ldquo;The only argument for it, worth considering,&rdquo;
I said in conclusion, &ldquo;seems to be his
supposed <i>reluctance</i> in releasing you from
your promise. I have tried to give to that
argument its <i>full</i> weight, and my conclusion
is that it does <i>not</i> affect the rights of the
case, or invalidate the release he has given
you. My belief is that you are <i>entirely</i> free
to act as <i>now</i> seems right.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">33</div>
<p>&ldquo;I am <i>very</i> grateful to you,&rdquo; she said
earnestly. &ldquo;Believe it, please! I ca&rsquo;n&rsquo;t put
it into proper words!&rdquo; and the subject was
dropped by mutual consent: and I only
learned, long afterwards, that our discussion
had really served to dispel the doubts that
had harassed her so long.</p>
<p>We parted at the Hall-gate, and I found
Arthur eagerly awaiting my arrival; and, before
we parted for the night, I had heard the whole
story&mdash;how he had put off his journey from
day to day, feeling that he <i>could</i> not go away
from the place till his fate had been irrevocably
settled by the wedding taking place: how the
preparations for the wedding, and the excitement
in the neighbourhood, had suddenly come
to an end, and he had learned (from Major
Lindon, who called to wish him good-bye) that
the engagement had been broken off by mutual
consent: how he had instantly abandoned all
his plans for going abroad, and had decided to
stay on at Elveston, for a year or two at any
rate, till his newly-awakened hopes should
prove true or false; and how, since that
memorable day, he had avoided all meetings
<span class="pb" id="Page_34">34</span>
with Lady Muriel, fearing to betray his
feelings before he had had any sufficient
evidence as to how she regarded him. &ldquo;But
it is nearly six weeks since all that happened,&rdquo;
he said in conclusion, &ldquo;and we can meet in the
ordinary way, now, with no need for any painful
allusions. I would have written to tell you all
this: only I kept hoping from day to day,
that&mdash;that there would be <i>more</i> to tell!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how should there be <i>more</i>, you foolish
fellow,&rdquo; I fondly urged, &ldquo;if you never even go
near her? Do you expect the offer to come
from <i>her</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Arthur was betrayed into a smile. &ldquo;No,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;I hardly expect <i>that</i>. But I&rsquo;m a
desperate coward. There&rsquo;s no doubt about it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what <i>reasons</i> have you heard of for
breaking off the engagement?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A good many,&rdquo; Arthur replied, and proceeded
to count them on his fingers. &ldquo;First, it
was found that she was dying of&mdash;something;
so <i>he</i> broke it off. Then it was found that <i>he</i>
was dying of&mdash;some other thing; so <i>she</i> broke
it off. Then the Major turned out to be a
confirmed gamester; so the <i>Earl</i> broke it off.
<span class="pb" id="Page_35">35</span>
Then the Earl insulted him; so the <i>Major</i>
broke it off. It got a good deal broken off, all
things considered!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have all this on the very best authority,
of course?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, certainly! And communicated in the
strictest confidence! Whatever defects Elveston
society suffers from, <i>want of information</i>
isn&rsquo;t one of them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor <i>reticence</i>, either, it seems. But, seriously,
do you know the real reason?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m quite in the dark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I did not feel that I had any right to
enlighten him; so I changed the subject, to the
less engrossing one of &ldquo;new milk,&rdquo; and we
agreed that I should walk over, next day, to
Hunter&rsquo;s farm, Arthur undertaking to set me
part of the way, after which he had to return
to keep a business-engagement.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>
<h2 id="c3">CHAPTER III.
<br /><span class="small">STREAKS OF DAWN.</span></h2>
<p>Next day proved warm and sunny, and we
started early, to enjoy the luxury of a good long
chat before he would be obliged to leave me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This neighbourhood has more than its due
proportion of the <i>very</i> poor,&rdquo; I remarked, as
we passed a group of hovels, too dilapidated
to deserve the name of &ldquo;cottages.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the few rich,&rdquo; Arthur replied, &ldquo;give
more than their due proportion of help in
charity. So the balance is kept.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose the <i>Earl</i> does a good deal?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He <i>gives</i> liberally; but he has not the
health or strength to do more. Lady Muriel
<span class="pb" id="Page_37">37</span>
does more in the way of school-teaching and
cottage-visiting than she would like me to
reveal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then <i>she</i>, at least, is not one of the &lsquo;idle
mouths&rsquo; one so often meets with among the
upper classes. I have sometimes thought they
would have a hard time of it, if suddenly
called on to give their <i>raison d&rsquo;&ecirc;tre</i>, and to
show cause why they should be allowed to
live any longer!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The whole subject,&rdquo; said Arthur, &ldquo;of what
we may call &lsquo;idle mouths&rsquo; (I mean persons
who absorb some of the material <i>wealth</i> of a
community&mdash;in the form of food, clothes, and
so on&mdash;without contributing its equivalent in
the form of productive <i>labour</i>) is a complicated
one, no doubt. I&rsquo;ve tried to think it
out. And it seemed to me that the simplest
form of the problem, to start with, is a community
without <i>money</i>, who buy and sell by
<i>barter</i> only; and it makes it yet simpler to
suppose the food and other things to be capable
of <i>keeping</i> for many years without spoiling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yours is an excellent plan,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;What
is your solution of the problem?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">38</div>
<p>&ldquo;The commonest type of &lsquo;idle mouths,&rsquo;&rdquo;
said Arthur, &ldquo;is no doubt due to money being
left by parents to their own children. So I
imagined a man&mdash;either exceptionally clever,
or exceptionally strong and industrious&mdash;who
had contributed so much valuable labour
to the needs of the community that its equivalent,
in clothes, &amp;c., was (say) five times as
much as he needed for himself. We cannot
deny his <i>absolute</i> right to give the superfluous
wealth as he chooses. So, if he leaves <i>four</i>
children behind him (say two sons and two
daughters), with enough of all the necessaries
of life to last them a life-time, I cannot see
that the <i>community</i> is in any way wronged if
they choose to do nothing in life but to &lsquo;eat,
drink, and be merry.&rsquo; Most certainly, the
community could not fairly say, in reference to
<i>them</i>, &lsquo;<i>if a man will not work, neither let him
eat</i>.&rsquo; Their reply would be crushing. &lsquo;The
labour has already been <i>done</i>, which is a fair
equivalent for the food we are eating; and
you have had the benefit of it. On what
principle of justice can you demand <i>two</i> quotas
of work for <i>one</i> quota of food?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yet surely,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;there is something
wrong <i>somewhere</i>, if these four people are well
able to do useful work, and if that work is
actually <i>needed</i> by the community, and they
elect to sit idle?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think there <i>is</i>,&rdquo; said Arthur: &ldquo;but it
seems to me to arise from a Law of God&mdash;that
every one shall do as much as he can
to help others&mdash;and not from any <i>rights</i>, on
the part of the community, to exact labour as
an equivalent for food that has already been
fairly earned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose the <i>second</i> form of the problem
is where the &lsquo;idle mouths&rsquo; possess <i>money</i> instead
of <i>material</i> wealth?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Arthur: &ldquo;and I think the
simplest case is that of <i>paper</i>-money. <i>Gold</i>
is itself a form of material wealth; but a bank-note
is merely a <i>promise</i> to hand over so
much <i>material</i> wealth when called upon to do
so. The father of these four &lsquo;idle mouths,&rsquo;
had done (let us say) five thousand pounds&rsquo;
worth of useful work for the community. In
return for this, the community had given him
what amounted to a written promise to hand
<span class="pb" id="Page_40">40</span>
over, whenever called upon to do so, five
thousand pounds&rsquo; worth of food, &amp;c. Then,
if he only uses <i>one</i> thousand pounds&rsquo; worth
himself, and leaves the rest of the notes to his
children, surely they have a full right to <i>present</i>
these written promises, and to say &lsquo;hand
over the food, for which the equivalent labour
has been already done.&rsquo; Now I think <i>this</i>
case well worth stating, publicly and clearly.
I should like to drive it into the heads of
those Socialists who are priming our ignorant
paupers with such sentiments as &lsquo;Look at
them bloated haristocrats! Doing not a stroke
o&rsquo; work for theirselves, and living on the sweat
of <i>our</i> brows!&rsquo; I should like to <i>force</i> them
to see that the <i>money</i>, which those &lsquo;haristocrats&rsquo;
are spending, represents so much labour
<i>already done</i> for the community, and whose
equivalent, in <i>material</i> wealth, is <i>due from
the community</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Might not the Socialists reply &lsquo;Much of
this money does not represent <i>honest</i> labour
<i>at all</i>. If you could trace it back, from owner
to owner, though you might begin with several
legitimate steps, such as gift, or bequeathing
<span class="pb" id="Page_41">41</span>
by will, or &lsquo;value received,&rsquo; you would soon
reach an owner who had no moral right to
it, but had got it by fraud or other crimes;
and of course his successors in the line would
have no better right to it than <i>he</i> had.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No doubt, no doubt,&rdquo; Arthur replied.
&ldquo;But surely that involves the logical fallacy
of <i>proving too much</i>? It is <i>quite</i> as applicable
to <i>material</i> wealth, as it is to <i>money</i>. If
we once begin to go back beyond the fact
that the <i>present</i> owner of certain property
came by it honestly, and to ask whether any
previous owner, in past ages, got it by fraud,
would <i>any</i> property be secure?&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a minute&rsquo;s thought, I felt obliged to
admit the truth of this.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My general conclusion,&rdquo; Arthur continued,
&ldquo;from the mere standpoint of human <i>rights</i>,
man against man, was this&mdash;that if some
wealthy &lsquo;idle mouth,&rsquo; who has come by his
money in a lawful way, even though not one
atom of the labour it represents has been his
own doing, chooses to spend it on his own
needs, without contributing any labour to the
community from whom he buys his food and
<span class="pb" id="Page_42">42</span>
clothes, that community has no <i>right</i> to interfere
with him. But it&rsquo;s quite another thing,
when we come to consider the <i>divine</i> law.
Measured by <i>that</i> standard, such a man is
undoubtedly doing wrong, if he fails to use,
for the good of those in need, the strength
or the skill, that God has given him. That
strength and skill do <i>not</i> belong to the community,
to be paid to <i>them</i> as a <i>debt</i>: they
do <i>not</i> belong to the man <i>himself</i>, to be used
for his <i>own</i> enjoyment: they <i>do</i> belong to God,
to be used according to <i>His</i> will; and we are
not left in doubt as to what that will is. &lsquo;<i>Do
good, and lend, hoping for nothing again.</i>&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyhow,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;an &lsquo;idle mouth&rsquo; very
often gives away a great deal in charity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In <i>so-called</i> &lsquo;charity,&rsquo;&rdquo; he corrected me.
&ldquo;Excuse me if I seem to speak <i>un</i>charitably.
I would not dream of <i>applying</i> the term to
any <i>individual</i>. But I would say, <i>generally</i>,
that a man who gratifies every fancy that
occurs to him&mdash;denying himself in <i>nothing</i>&mdash;and
merely gives to the poor some part, or
even <i>all</i>, of his <i>superfluous</i> wealth, is only
deceiving himself if he calls it <i>charity</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<p>&ldquo;But, even in giving away <i>superfluous</i>
wealth, he <i>may</i> be denying himself the miser&rsquo;s
pleasure in hoarding?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I grant you that, gladly,&rdquo; said Arthur.
&ldquo;Given that he <i>has</i> that morbid craving, he
is doing a good deed in restraining it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, even in spending on <i>himself</i>,&rdquo; I persisted,
&ldquo;our typical rich man often does good,
by employing people who would otherwise be
out of work: and that is often better than
pauperising them by <i>giving</i> the money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;ve said that!&rdquo; said Arthur.
&ldquo;I would not like to quit the subject without
exposing the <i>two</i> fallacies of that statement&mdash;which
have gone so long uncontradicted that
Society now accepts it as an axiom!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are they?&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t even
see <i>one</i>, myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One is merely the fallacy of <i>ambiguity</i>&mdash;the
assumption that &lsquo;<i>doing good</i>&rsquo; (that is, benefiting
somebody) is necessarily <i>a good thing to
do</i> (that is, a <i>right</i> thing). The other is the
assumption that, if one of two specified acts
is <i>better</i> than another, it is necessarily a <i>good</i>
act in itself. I should like to call this the
<span class="pb" id="Page_44">44</span>
fallacy of <i>comparison</i>&mdash;meaning that it assumes
that what is <i>comparatively</i> good is
therefore <i>positively</i> good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then what is <i>your</i> test of a good act?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That it shall be <i>our best</i>,&rdquo; Arthur confidently
replied. &ldquo;And even <i>then</i> &lsquo;<i>we are
unprofitable servants</i>.&rsquo; But let me illustrate
the two fallacies. Nothing illustrates a fallacy
so well as an extreme case, which fairly
comes under it. Suppose I find two children
drowning in a pond. I rush in, and save one
of the children, and then walk away, leaving
the other to drown. Clearly I have &lsquo;<i>done good</i>,&rsquo;
in saving a child&rsquo;s life? But&mdash;&mdash;. Again,
supposing I meet an inoffensive stranger, and
knock him down, and walk on. Clearly that
is &lsquo;<i>better</i>&rsquo; than if I had proceeded to jump
upon him and break his ribs? But&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those &lsquo;buts&rsquo; are quite unanswerable,&rdquo; I
said. &ldquo;But I should like an instance from
<i>real</i> life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, let us take one of those abominations
of modern Society, a Charity-Bazaar.
It&rsquo;s an interesting question to think out&mdash;how
much of the money, that reaches the object in
<span class="pb" id="Page_45">45</span>
view, is <i>genuine</i> charity; and whether even
<i>that</i> is spent in the <i>best</i> way. But the subject
needs regular classification, and analysis, to
understand it properly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should be glad to <i>have</i> it analysed,&rdquo; I
said: &ldquo;it has often puzzled me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if I am really not boring you. Let
us suppose our Charity-Bazaar to have been
organised to aid the funds of some Hospital:
and that A, B, C <i>give</i> their services in making
articles to sell, and in acting as salesmen,
while X, Y, Z buy the articles, and the money
so paid goes to the Hospital.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are two distinct species of such
Bazaars: one, where the payment exacted is
merely the <i>market-value</i> of the goods supplied,
that is, exactly what you would have to pay at
a shop: the other, where <i>fancy-prices</i> are
asked. We must take these separately.</p>
<p>&ldquo;First, the &lsquo;market-value&rsquo; case. Here A,
B, C are exactly in the same position as ordinary
shopkeepers; the only difference being that
they give the proceeds to the Hospital. Practically,
they are <i>giving their skilled labour</i> for
the benefit of the Hospital. This seems to
<span class="pb" id="Page_46">46</span>
me to be genuine charity. And I don&rsquo;t see
how they could use it better. But X, Y, Z,
are exactly in the same position as any
ordinary purchasers of goods. To talk of
&lsquo;charity&rsquo; in connection with <i>their</i> share of the
business, is sheer nonsense. Yet they are
very likely to do so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Secondly, the case of &lsquo;fancy-prices.&rsquo; Here
I think the simplest plan is to divide the payment
into two parts, the &lsquo;market-value&rsquo; and
the excess over that. The &lsquo;market-value&rsquo;
part is on the same footing as in the first case:
the <i>excess</i> is all we have to consider. Well,
A, B, C do not <i>earn</i> it; so we may put <i>them</i>
out of the question: it is a <i>gift</i>, from X, Y, Z,
to the Hospital. And my opinion is that it is
not given in the best way: far better buy what
they choose to <i>buy</i>, and give what they choose
to <i>give</i>, as two <i>separate</i> transactions: then
there is <i>some</i> chance that their motive in giving
may be real charity, instead of a mixed
motive&mdash;half charity, half self-pleasing. &lsquo;The
trail of the serpent is over it all.&rsquo; And <i>therefore</i>
it is that I hold all such spurious
&lsquo;Charities&rsquo; in <i>utter</i> abomination!&rdquo; He ended
<span class="pb" id="Page_47">47</span>
with unusual energy, and savagely beheaded,
with his stick, a tall thistle at the road-side,
behind which I was startled to see Sylvie
and Bruno standing. I caught at his arm,
but too late to stop him. Whether the
stick reached them, or not, I could not feel
sure: at any rate they took not the smallest
notice of it, but smiled gaily, and nodded to
me; and I saw at once that they were only
visible to <i>me</i>: the &lsquo;eerie&rsquo; influence had not
reached to <i>Arthur</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did you try to save it?&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;<i>That&rsquo;s</i> not the wheedling Secretary of a
Charity-Bazaar! I only wish it were!&rdquo; he
added grimly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doos oo know, that stick went right froo
my head!&rdquo; said Bruno. (They had run round
to me by this time, and each had secured a
hand.) &ldquo;Just under my chin! I <i>are</i> glad I
aren&rsquo;t a thistle!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ve threshed <i>that</i> subject out,
anyhow!&rdquo; Arthur resumed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;ve
been talking too much, for <i>your</i> patience and
for my strength. I must be turning soon.
This is about the end of my tether.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">48</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Take, O boatman, thrice thy fee;</p>
<p class="t0">Take, I give it willingly;</p>
<p class="t0">For, invisible to thee,</p>
<p class="t0">Spirits twain have crossed with me!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>I quoted, involuntarily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For utterly inappropriate and irrelevant
quotations,&rdquo; laughed Arthur, &ldquo;you are &lsquo;ekalled
by few, and excelled by none&rsquo;!&rdquo; And we
strolled on.</p>
<p>As we passed the head of the lane that led
down to the beach, I noticed a single figure,
moving slowly along it, seawards. She was a
good way off, and had her back to us: but it
was Lady Muriel, unmistakably. Knowing
that Arthur had not seen her, as he had been
looking, in the other direction, at a gathering
rain-cloud, I made no remark, but tried to
think of some plausible pretext for sending
him back by the sea.</p>
<p>The opportunity instantly presented itself.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m getting tired,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think
it would be prudent to go further. I had
better turn here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I turned with him, for a few steps, and as
we again approached the head of the lane, I
<span class="pb" id="Page_49">49</span>
said, as carelessly as I could, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go back
by the road. It&rsquo;s too hot and dusty. Down
this lane, and along the beach, is nearly as
short; and you&rsquo;ll get a breeze off the sea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I think I will,&rdquo; Arthur began; but at
that moment we came into sight of Lady
Muriel, and he checked himself. &ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s
too far round. Yet it certainly <i>would</i> be
cooler&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; He stood, hesitating, looking
first one way and then the other&mdash;a melancholy
picture of utter infirmity of purpose!</p>
<p>How long this humiliating scene would have
continued, if <i>I</i> had been the only external
influence, it is impossible to say; for at this
moment Sylvie, with a swift decision worthy
of Napoleon himself, took the matter into
her own hands. &ldquo;You go and drive <i>her</i>, up
this way,&rdquo; she said to Bruno. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get <i>him</i>
along!&rdquo; And she took hold of the stick that
Arthur was carrying, and gently pulled him
down the lane.</p>
<p>He was totally unconscious that any will
but his own was acting on the stick, and
appeared to think it had taken a horizontal
position simply because he was pointing with
<span class="pb" id="Page_50">50</span>
it. &ldquo;Are not those <i>orchises</i> under the hedge
there?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I think that decides me.
I&rsquo;ll gather some as I go along.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img" id="fig4">
<img src="images/i050.jpg" alt="&lsquo;ARE NOT THOSE ORCHISES?&rsquo;" width="500" height="578" />
<p class="center small">&lsquo;ARE NOT THOSE ORCHISES?&rsquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Meanwhile Bruno had run on beyond Lady
Muriel, and, with much jumping about and shouting
(shouts audible to no one but Sylvie and
myself), much as if he were driving sheep, he
managed to turn her round and make her
<span class="pb" id="Page_51">51</span>
walk, with eyes demurely cast upon the ground,
in our direction.</p>
<p>The victory was ours! And, since it was
evident that the lovers, thus urged together,
<i>must</i> meet in another minute, I turned and
walked on, hoping that Sylvie and Bruno
would follow my example, as I felt sure that
the fewer the spectators the better it would be
for Arthur and his good angel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what sort of meeting was it?&rdquo; I
wondered, as I paced dreamily on.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">52</div>
<h2 id="c4">CHAPTER IV.
<br /><span class="small">THE DOG-KING.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;They shooked hands,&rdquo; said Bruno, who
was trotting at my side, in answer to the unspoken
question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And they looked <i>ever</i> so pleased!&rdquo; Sylvie
added from the other side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we must get on, now, as quick as we
can,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;If only I knew the best way to
Hunter&rsquo;s farm!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll be sure to know in this cottage,&rdquo;
said Sylvie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I suppose they will. Bruno, would
you run in and ask?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">53</div>
<p>Sylvie stopped him, laughingly, as he ran off.
&ldquo;Wait a minute,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I must make you
<i>visible</i> first, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And <i>audible</i> too, I suppose?&rdquo; I said, as she
took the jewel, that hung round her neck, and
waved it over his head, and touched his eyes
and lips with it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Sylvie: &ldquo;and <i>once</i>, do you know,
I made him <i>audible</i>, and forgot to make him
<i>visible</i>! And he went to buy some sweeties in
a shop. And the man <i>was</i> so frightened! A
voice seemed to come out of the air, &lsquo;Please, I
want two ounces of barley-sugar drops!&rsquo; And
a shilling came <i>bang</i> down upon the counter!
And the man said &lsquo;I ca&rsquo;n&rsquo;t <i>see</i> you!&rsquo; And
Bruno said &lsquo;It doosn&rsquo;t sinnify seeing <i>me</i>, so
long as oo can see the <i>shilling</i>!&rsquo; But the man
said he never sold barley-sugar drops to people
he couldn&rsquo;t <i>see</i>. So we had to&mdash;<i>Now</i>, Bruno,
you&rsquo;re ready!&rdquo; And away he trotted.</p>
<p>Sylvie spent the time, while we were waiting
for him, in making <i>herself</i> visible also. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
rather awkward, you know,&rdquo; she explained to
me, &ldquo;when we meet people, and they can see
<i>one</i> of us, and ca&rsquo;n&rsquo;t see the <i>other</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">54</div>
<p>In a minute or two Bruno returned, looking
rather disconsolate. &ldquo;He&rsquo;d got friends with
him, and he were <i>cross</i>!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;He asked
me who I were. And I said &lsquo;I&rsquo;m Bruno: who
is <i>these</i> peoples?&rsquo; And he said &lsquo;One&rsquo;s my
half-brother, and t&rsquo;other&rsquo;s my half-sister: and I
don&rsquo;t want no more company! Go along with
yer!&rsquo; And I said &lsquo;I ca&rsquo;n&rsquo;t go along <i>wizout</i>
mine self!&rsquo; And I said &lsquo;Oo shouldn&rsquo;t have <i>bits</i>
of peoples lying about like that! It&rsquo;s welly
untidy!&rsquo; And he said &lsquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t talk to <i>me</i>!&rsquo;
And he pushted me outside! And he shutted
the door!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you never asked where Hunter&rsquo;s farm
was?&rdquo; queried Sylvie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hadn&rsquo;t room for any questions,&rdquo; said
Bruno. &ldquo;The room were so crowded.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three people <i>couldn&rsquo;t</i> crowd a room,&rdquo; said
Sylvie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They <i>did</i>, though,&rdquo; Bruno persisted. &ldquo;<i>He</i>
crowded it most. He&rsquo;s such a welly <i>thick</i>
man&mdash;so as oo couldn&rsquo;t knock him down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I failed to see the drift of Bruno&rsquo;s argument.
&ldquo;Surely <i>anybody</i> could be knocked down,&rdquo; I
said: &ldquo;thick or thin wouldn&rsquo;t matter.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">55</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oo couldn&rsquo;t knock <i>him</i> down,&rdquo; said Bruno.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s more wider than he&rsquo;s high: so, when
he&rsquo;s lying down, he&rsquo;s more higher than when
he&rsquo;s standing: so a-course oo couldn&rsquo;t knock
him <i>down</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s another cottage,&rdquo; I said: &ldquo;<i>I&rsquo;ll</i> ask
the way, <i>this</i> time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was no need to go in, this time, as the
woman was standing in the doorway, with a
baby in her arms, talking to a respectably
dressed man&mdash;a farmer, as I guessed&mdash;who
seemed to be on his way to the town.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&mdash;and when there&rsquo;s <i>drink</i> to be had,&rdquo; he
was saying, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s just the worst o&rsquo; the lot, is
your Willie. So they tell me. He gets fairly
mad wi&rsquo; it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d have given &rsquo;em the lie to their faces, a
twelvemonth back!&rdquo; the woman said in a
broken voice. &ldquo;But a&rsquo; canna noo! A&rsquo; canna
noo!&rdquo; She checked herself, on catching sight
of us, and hastily retreated into the house,
shutting the door after her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you can tell me where Hunter&rsquo;s
farm is?&rdquo; I said to the man, as he turned away
from the house.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">56</div>
<p>&ldquo;I can <i>that</i>, Sir!&rdquo; he replied with a smile.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m John Hunter hissel, at your sarvice.
It&rsquo;s nobbut half a mile further&mdash;the only
house in sight, when you get round bend o&rsquo; the
road yonder. You&rsquo;ll find my good woman
within, if so be you&rsquo;ve business wi&rsquo; <i>her</i>. Or
mebbe I&rsquo;ll do as well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I want to order some
milk. Perhaps I had better arrange it with
your wife?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye,&rdquo; said the man. &ldquo;<i>She</i> minds all <i>that</i>.
Good day t&rsquo;ye, Master&mdash;and to your bonnie
childer, as well!&rdquo; And he trudged on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He should have said &lsquo;<i>child</i>,&rsquo; not &lsquo;<i>childer</i>&rsquo;,&rdquo;
said Bruno. &ldquo;Sylvie&rsquo;s not a <i>childer</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He meant <i>both</i> of us,&rdquo; said Sylvie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, he didn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; Bruno persisted. &ldquo;&rsquo;cause
he said &lsquo;bonnie&rsquo;, oo know!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, at any rate he <i>looked</i> at us both,&rdquo;
Sylvie maintained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then he <i>must</i> have seen we&rsquo;re not
<i>both</i> bonnie!&rdquo; Bruno retorted. &ldquo;A-<i>course</i> I&rsquo;m
much uglier than <i>oo</i>! Didn&rsquo;t he mean <i>Sylvie</i>,
Mister Sir?&rdquo; he shouted over his shoulder, as
he ran off.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">57</div>
<p>But there was no use in replying, as he had
already vanished round the bend of the road.
When we overtook him he was climbing a
gate, and was gazing earnestly into the field,
where a horse, a cow, and a kid were browsing
amicably together. &ldquo;For its father, a <i>Horse</i>,&rdquo;
he murmured to himself. &ldquo;For its mother, a
<i>Cow</i>. For their dear little child, a <i>little</i> Goat,
is the most curiousest thing I ever seen in my
world!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bruno&rsquo;s World!&rdquo; I pondered. &ldquo;Yes, I
suppose every child has a world of his own&mdash;and
every man, too, for the matter of that.
I wonder if <i>that&rsquo;s</i> the cause for all the misunderstanding
there is in Life?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That <i>must</i> be Hunter&rsquo;s farm!&rdquo; said Sylvie,
pointing to a house on the brow of the hill, led
up to by a cart-road. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no other farm
in sight, <i>this</i> way; and you <i>said</i> we must be
nearly there by this time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had <i>thought</i> it, while Bruno was climbing
the gate, but I couldn&rsquo;t remember having <i>said</i>
it. However, Sylvie was evidently in the
right. &ldquo;Get down, Bruno,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;and open
the gate for us.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">58</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a good thing we&rsquo;s with oo, <i>isn&rsquo;t</i> it,
Mister Sir?&rdquo; said Bruno, as we entered the
field. &ldquo;That big dog might have bited oo, if
oo&rsquo;d been alone! Oo needn&rsquo;t be <i>flightened</i>
of it!&rdquo; he whispered, clinging tight to my hand
to encourage me. &ldquo;It aren&rsquo;t fierce!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fierce!&rdquo; Sylvie scornfully echoed, as the
dog&mdash;a magnificent Newfoundland&mdash;that had
come galloping down the field to meet us,
began curveting round us, in gambols full of
graceful beauty, and welcoming us with short
joyful barks. &ldquo;Fierce! Why, it&rsquo;s as gentle
as a lamb! It&rsquo;s&mdash;why, Bruno, don&rsquo;t you
know it? It&rsquo;s&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So it <i>are</i>!&rdquo; cried Bruno, rushing forwards
and throwing his arms round its neck. &ldquo;Oh,
you <i>dear</i> dog!&rdquo; And it seemed as if the two
children would never have done hugging and
stroking it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how <i>ever</i> did he get <i>here</i>?&rdquo; said Bruno.
&ldquo;Ask him, Sylvie. I doosn&rsquo;t know how.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then began an eager talk in Doggee,
which of course was lost upon <i>me</i>; and I could
only <i>guess</i>, when the beautiful creature, with
a sly glance at me, whispered something in
<span class="pb" id="Page_59">59</span>
Sylvie&rsquo;s ear, that <i>I</i> was now the subject of conversation.
Sylvie looked round laughingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He asked me who you are,&rdquo; she explained.
&ldquo;And I said &lsquo;He&rsquo;s our <i>friend</i>.&rsquo; And he said
&lsquo;What&rsquo;s his name?&rsquo; And I said &lsquo;It&rsquo;s <i>Mister
Sir</i>.&rsquo; And he said &lsquo;Bosh!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is &lsquo;Bosh!&rsquo; in Doggee?&rdquo; I enquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the same as in English,&rdquo; said Sylvie.
&ldquo;Only, when a <i>dog</i> says it, it&rsquo;s a sort of a
whisper, that&rsquo;s half a <i>cough</i> and half a <i>bark</i>.
Nero, say &lsquo;<i>Bosh!</i>&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Nero, who had now begun gamboling
round us again, said &ldquo;<i>Bosh!</i>&rdquo; several times;
and I found that Sylvie&rsquo;s description of the
sound was perfectly accurate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder what&rsquo;s behind this long wall?&rdquo;
I said, as we walked on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the <i>Orchard</i>,&rdquo; Sylvie replied, after a
consultation with Nero. &ldquo;See, there&rsquo;s a boy
getting down off the wall, at that far corner.
And now he&rsquo;s running away across the field. I
do believe he&rsquo;s been stealing the apples!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bruno set off after him, but returned to us in
a few moments, as he had evidently no chance
of overtaking the young rascal.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">60</div>
<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t catch him!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I wiss
I&rsquo;d started a little sooner. His pockets <i>was</i>
full of apples!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Dog-King looked up at Sylvie, and
said something in Doggee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, of <i>course</i> you can!&rdquo; Sylvie exclaimed.
&ldquo;How stupid not to think of it! <i>Nero</i>&rsquo;ll hold
him for us, Bruno! But I&rsquo;d better make him
invisible, first.&rdquo; And she hastily got out the
Magic Jewel, and began waving it over Nero&rsquo;s
head, and down along his back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;ll do!&rdquo; cried Bruno, impatiently.
&ldquo;After him, good Doggie!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Bruno!&rdquo; Sylvie exclaimed reproachfully.
&ldquo;You shouldn&rsquo;t have sent him off so
quick! I hadn&rsquo;t done the tail!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Meanwhile Nero was coursing like a greyhound
down the field: so at least I concluded
from all <i>I</i> could see of him&mdash;the long feathery
tail, which floated like a meteor through the
air&mdash;and in a very few seconds he had come
up with the little thief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s got him safe, by one foot!&rdquo; cried
Sylvie, who was eagerly watching the chase.
&ldquo;Now there&rsquo;s no hurry, Bruno!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">61</div>
<p>So we walked, quite leisurely, down the
field, to where the frightened lad stood. A
more curious sight I had seldom seen, in all
my &lsquo;eerie&rsquo; experiences. Every bit of him was
in violent action, except the left foot, which was
apparently glued to the ground&mdash;there being
nothing visibly holding it: while, at some little
distance, the long feathery tail was waving
gracefully from side to side, showing that Nero,
at least, regarded the whole affair as nothing
but a magnificent game of play.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with you?&rdquo; I said, as
gravely as I could.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got the crahmp in me ahnkle!&rdquo; the thief
groaned in reply. &ldquo;An&rsquo; me fut&rsquo;s gone to
sleep!&rdquo; And he began to blubber aloud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, look here!&rdquo; Bruno said in a commanding
tone, getting in front of him. &ldquo;Oo&rsquo;ve
got to give up those apples!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lad glanced at me, but didn&rsquo;t seem
to reckon <i>my</i> interference as worth anything.
Then he glanced at Sylvie: <i>she</i> clearly didn&rsquo;t
count for very much, either. Then he took
courage. &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll take a better man than any of
<i>yer</i> to get &rsquo;em!&rdquo; he retorted defiantly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">62</div>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">63</div>
<p>Sylvie stooped and patted the invisible Nero.
&ldquo;A <i>little</i> tighter!&rdquo; she whispered. And a sharp
yell from the ragged boy showed how promptly
the Dog-King had taken the hint.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter <i>now</i>?&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Is
your ankle worse?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it&rsquo;ll get worse, and worse, and worse,&rdquo;
Bruno solemnly assured him, &ldquo;till oo gives
up those apples!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Apparently the thief was convinced of this
at last, and he sulkily began emptying his
pockets of the apples. The children watched
from a little distance, Bruno dancing with
delight at every fresh yell extracted from
Nero&rsquo;s terrified prisoner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all,&rdquo; the boy said at last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It <i>isn&rsquo;t</i> all!&rdquo; cried Bruno. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s three
more in that pocket!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another hint from Sylvie to the Dog-King&mdash;another
sharp yell from the thief, now
convicted of lying also&mdash;and the remaining
three apples were surrendered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let him go, please,&rdquo; Sylvie said in Doggee,
and the lad limped away at a great pace,
stooping now and then to rub the ailing ankle,
in fear, seemingly, that the &lsquo;crahmp&rsquo; might
attack it again.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">65</div>
<p>Bruno ran back, with his booty, to the
orchard wall, and pitched the apples over it
one by one. &ldquo;I&rsquo;s welly afraid <i>some</i> of them&rsquo;s
gone under the wrong trees!&rdquo; he panted, on
overtaking us again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The <i>wrong</i> trees!&rdquo; laughed Sylvie. &ldquo;Trees
<i>ca&rsquo;n&rsquo;t</i> do wrong! There&rsquo;s no such things as
<i>wrong</i> trees!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then there&rsquo;s no such things as <i>right</i>
trees, neither!&rdquo; cried Bruno. And Sylvie gave
up the point.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait a minute, please!&rdquo; she said to me.
&ldquo;I must make Nero <i>visible</i>, you know!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, <i>please</i> don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; cried Bruno, who had
by this time mounted on the Royal back, and
was twisting the Royal hair into a bridle.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be <i>such</i> fun to have him like this!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it <i>does</i> look funny,&rdquo; Sylvie admitted,
and led the way to the farm-house, where the
farmer&rsquo;s wife stood, evidently much perplexed
at the weird procession now approaching her.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s summat gone wrong wi&rsquo; my spectacles,
I doubt!&rdquo; she murmured, as she took them
<span class="pb" id="Page_66">66</span>
off, and began diligently rubbing them with a
corner of her apron.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Sylvie had hastily pulled Bruno
down from his steed, and had just time to make
His Majesty wholly visible before the spectacles
were resumed.</p>
<p>All was natural, now; but the good woman
still looked a little uneasy about it. &ldquo;My
eyesight&rsquo;s getting bad,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but I see
you <i>now</i>, my darlings! You&rsquo;ll give me a kiss,
wo&rsquo;n&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bruno got behind me, in a moment: however
Sylvie put up <i>her</i> face, to be kissed, as representative
of <i>both</i>, and we all went in together.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">67</div>
<h2 id="c5">CHAPTER V.
<br /><span class="small">MATILDA JANE.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Come to me, my little gentleman,&rdquo; said
our hostess, lifting Bruno into her lap, &ldquo;and
tell me everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ca&rsquo;n&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Bruno. &ldquo;There wouldn&rsquo;t be
time. Besides, I don&rsquo;t <i>know</i> everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The good woman looked a little puzzled,
and turned to Sylvie for help. &ldquo;Does he like
<i>riding</i>?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I <i>think</i> so,&rdquo; Sylvie gently replied.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s just had a ride on <i>Nero</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, Nero&rsquo;s a grand dog, isn&rsquo;t he? Were
you ever outside a <i>horse</i>, my little man?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">68</div>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Always!</i>&rdquo; Bruno said with great decision.
&ldquo;Never was <i>inside</i> one. Was <i>oo</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here I thought it well to interpose, and to
mention the business on which we had come,
and so relieved her, for a few minutes, from
Bruno&rsquo;s perplexing questions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And those dear children will like a bit of
cake, <i>I&rsquo;ll</i> warrant!&rdquo; said the farmer&rsquo;s hospitable
wife, when the business was concluded, as she
opened her cupboard, and brought out a cake.
&ldquo;And don&rsquo;t you waste the crust, little gentleman!&rdquo;
she added, as she handed a good slice
of it to Bruno. &ldquo;You know what the poetry-book
says about wilful waste?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Bruno. &ldquo;What doos he
say about it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell him, Bessie!&rdquo; And the mother looked
down, proudly and lovingly, on a rosy little
maiden, who had just crept shyly into the room,
and was leaning against her knee. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s
that your poetry-book says about wilful waste?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>For wilful waste makes woeful want</i>,&rdquo; Bessie
recited, in an almost inaudible whisper: &ldquo;<i>and you
may live to say &lsquo;How much I wish I had the
crust that then I threw away!&rsquo;</i>&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">69</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now try if <i>you</i> can say it, my dear! <i>For
wilful</i>&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>For wifful</i>&mdash;sumfinoruvver&mdash;&rdquo; Bruno began,
readily enough; and then there came a
dead pause. &ldquo;Ca&rsquo;n&rsquo;t remember no more!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what do you <i>learn</i> from it, then? You
can tell us <i>that</i>, at any rate?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bruno ate a little more cake, and considered:
but the moral did not seem to him to be a very
obvious one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Always to&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Sylvie prompted him in
a whisper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Always to&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Bruno softly repeated: and
then, with sudden inspiration, &ldquo;always to look
where it goes to!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where <i>what</i> goes to, darling?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why the <i>crust</i>, a course!&rdquo; said Bruno.
&ldquo;Then, if I lived to say &lsquo;<i>How much I wiss
I had the crust</i>&mdash;&rsquo; (and all that), I&rsquo;d know
where I frew it to!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This new interpretation quite puzzled the
good woman. She returned to the subject of
&lsquo;Bessie.&rsquo; &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t you like to see Bessie&rsquo;s
doll, my dears! Bessie, take the little lady and
gentleman to see Matilda Jane!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">70</div>
<p>Bessie&rsquo;s shyness thawed away in a moment.
&ldquo;Matilda Jane has just woke up,&rdquo; she stated,
confidentially, to Sylvie. &ldquo;Wo&rsquo;n&rsquo;t you help
me on with her frock? Them strings <i>is</i> such
a bother to tie!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can tie <i>strings</i>,&rdquo; we heard, in Sylvie&rsquo;s
gentle voice, as the two little girls left the room
together. Bruno ignored the whole proceeding,
and strolled to the window, quite with the air of
a fashionable gentleman. Little girls, and dolls,
were not at all in his line.</p>
<p>And forthwith the fond mother proceeded to
tell me (as what mother is not ready to do?)
of all Bessie&rsquo;s virtues (and vices too, for the
matter of that) and of the many fearful maladies
which, notwithstanding those ruddy cheeks and
that plump little figure, had nearly, time and
again, swept her from the face of the earth.</p>
<p>When the full stream of loving memories had
nearly run itself out, I began to question her
about the working men of that neighbourhood,
and specially the &lsquo;Willie,&rsquo; whom we had heard
of at his cottage. &ldquo;He was a good fellow
once,&rdquo; said my kind hostess: &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s the drink
has ruined him! Not that I&rsquo;d rob them of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_71">71</span>
drink&mdash;it&rsquo;s good for the most of them&mdash;but
there&rsquo;s some as is too weak to stand
agin&rsquo; temptations: it&rsquo;s a thousand pities, for
<i>them</i>, as they ever built the Golden Lion at
the corner there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Golden Lion?&rdquo; I repeated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the new Public,&rdquo; my hostess explained.
&ldquo;And it stands right in the way, and handy
for the workmen, as they come back from the
brickfields, as it might be to-day, with their
week&rsquo;s wages. A deal of money gets wasted
that way. And some of &rsquo;em gets drunk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If only they could have it in their own
houses&mdash;&rdquo; I mused, hardly knowing I had said
the words out loud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it!&rdquo; she eagerly exclaimed. It was
evidently a solution, of the problem, that she
had already thought out. &ldquo;If only you could
manage, so&rsquo;s each man to have his own little
barrel in his own house&mdash;there&rsquo;d hardly be
a drunken man in the length and breadth of
the land!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then I told her the old story&mdash;about
a certain cottager who bought himself a little
barrel of beer, and installed his wife as bar-keeper:
<span class="pb" id="Page_72">72</span>
and how, every time he wanted his
mug of beer, he regularly paid her over the
counter for it: and how she never would let
him go on &lsquo;tick,&rsquo; and was a perfectly inflexible
bar-keeper in never letting him have more than
his proper allowance: and how, every time the
barrel needed refilling, she had plenty to do it
with, and something over for her money-box:
and how, at the end of the year, he not
only found himself in first-rate health and spirits,
with that undefinable but quite unmistakeable
air which always distinguishes the sober man
from the one who takes &lsquo;a drop too much,&rsquo; but
had quite a box full of money, all saved out of
his own pence!</p>
<p>&ldquo;If only they&rsquo;d all do like that!&rdquo; said the
good woman, wiping her eyes, which were overflowing
with kindly sympathy. &ldquo;Drink hadn&rsquo;t
need to be the curse it is to some&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only a <i>curse</i>,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;when it is used
wrongly. Any of God&rsquo;s gifts may be turned
into a curse, unless we use it wisely. But
we must be getting home. Would you call the
little girls? Matilda Jane has seen enough
of company, for <i>one</i> day, I&rsquo;m sure!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">73</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll find &rsquo;em in a minute,&rdquo; said my hostess,
as she rose to leave the room. &ldquo;Maybe that
young gentleman saw which way they went?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are they, Bruno?&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They ain&rsquo;t in the field,&rdquo; was Bruno&rsquo;s rather
evasive reply, &ldquo;&rsquo;cause there&rsquo;s nothing but <i>pigs</i>
there, and Sylvie isn&rsquo;t a pig. Now don&rsquo;t
imperrupt me any more, &rsquo;cause I&rsquo;m telling a
story to this fly; and it won&rsquo;t attend!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re among the apples, I&rsquo;ll warrant
&rsquo;em!&rdquo; said the Farmer&rsquo;s wife. So we left
Bruno to finish his story, and went out into the
orchard, where we soon came upon the children,
walking sedately side by side, Sylvie carrying
the doll, while little Bess carefully shaded its
face, with a large cabbage-leaf for a parasol.</p>
<p>As soon as they caught sight of us, little Bess
dropped her cabbage-leaf and came running to
meet us, Sylvie following more slowly, as her
precious charge evidently needed great care
and attention.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m its Mamma, and Sylvie&rsquo;s the Head-Nurse,&rdquo;
Bessie explained: &ldquo;and Sylvie&rsquo;s taught
me ever such a pretty song, for me to sing to
Matilda Jane!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">74</div>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s hear it once more, Sylvie,&rdquo; I said,
delighted at getting the chance I had long
wished for, of hearing her sing. But Sylvie
turned shy and frightened in a moment. &ldquo;No,
<i>please</i> not!&rdquo; she said, in an earnest &lsquo;aside&rsquo; to
me. &ldquo;Bessie knows it quite perfect now.
Bessie can sing it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye, aye! Let Bessie sing it!&rdquo; said the
proud mother. &ldquo;Bessie has a bonny voice of
her own,&rdquo; (this again was an &lsquo;aside&rsquo; to me)
&ldquo;though I say it as shouldn&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bessie was only too happy to accept the
&lsquo;encore.&rsquo; So the plump little Mamma sat
down at our feet, with her hideous daughter
reclining stiffly across her lap (it was one of
a kind that wo&rsquo;n&rsquo;t sit down, under <i>any</i> amount
of persuasion), and, with a face simply beaming
with delight, began the lullaby, in a shout that
<i>ought</i> to have frightened the poor baby into fits.
The Head-Nurse crouched down behind her,
keeping herself respectfully in the back-ground,
with her hands on the shoulders of her little
mistress, so as to be ready to act as Prompter,
if required, and to supply &lsquo;<i>each gap in faithless
memory void</i>.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">75</div>
<div class="img" id="fig7">
<img src="images/i075.jpg" alt="BESSIE&rsquo;S SONG" width="500" height="523" />
<p class="center small">BESSIE&rsquo;S SONG</p>
</div>
<p>The shout, with which she began, proved to
be only a momentary effort. After a very few
notes, Bessie toned down, and sang on in a
small but very sweet voice. At first her great
black eyes were fixed on her mother, but soon
her gaze wandered upwards, among the apples,
and she seemed to have quite forgotten that
she had any other audience than her Baby, and
her Head-Nurse, who once or twice supplied,
almost inaudibly, the right note, when the singer
was getting a little &lsquo;flat.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">76</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Matilda Jane, you never look</p>
<p class="t0">At any toy or picture-book:</p>

</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;I ask you riddles, tell you tales,</p>
<p class="t0">But <span class="norm">all</span> our conversation fails:</p>

<p class="t0">I fear you&rsquo;re dumb, Matilda Jane!</p>

<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Matilda, darling, when I call,</p>
<p class="t0">You never seem to hear at all:</p>
<p class="t0">I shout with all my might and main&mdash;</p>
<p class="t0">But you&rsquo;re <span class="norm">so</span> deaf, Matilda Jane!</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Matilda Jane, you needn&rsquo;t mind;</p>
<p class="t0">For, though you&rsquo;re deaf, and dumb, and blind,</p>
<p class="t0">There&rsquo;s <span class="norm">some one</span> loves you, it is plain&mdash;</p>
<p class="t0">And that is <span class="norm">me,</span> Matilda Jane!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>She sang three of the verses in a rather perfunctory
style, but the last stanza evidently
excited the little maiden. Her voice rose, ever
clearer and louder: she had a rapt look on her
face, as if suddenly inspired, and, as she sang
the last few words, she clasped to her heart
the inattentive Matilda Jane.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">77</div>
<p>&ldquo;Kiss it now!&rdquo; prompted the Head-Nurse.
And in a moment the simpering meaningless
face of the Baby was covered with a shower
of passionate kisses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a bonny song!&rdquo; cried the Farmer&rsquo;s
wife. &ldquo;Who made the words, dearie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I think I&rsquo;ll look for Bruno,&rdquo; Sylvie
said demurely, and left us hastily. The curious
child seemed always afraid of being praised, or
even noticed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sylvie planned the words,&rdquo; Bessie informed
us, proud of her superior information: &ldquo;and
Bruno planned the music&mdash;and <i>I</i> sang it!&rdquo;
(this last circumstance, by the way, we did not
need to be told).</p>
<p>So we followed Sylvie, and all entered the
parlour together. Bruno was still standing at
the window, with his elbows on the sill. He
had, apparently, finished the story that he was
telling to the fly, and had found a new
occupation. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t imperrupt!&rdquo; he said as
we came in. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m counting the Pigs in the
field!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How many are there?&rdquo; I enquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;About a thousand and four,&rdquo; said Bruno.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">78</div>
<p>&ldquo;You mean &lsquo;about a thousand,&rsquo;&rdquo; Sylvie
corrected him. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no good saying &lsquo;<i>and
four</i>&rsquo;: you <i>ca&rsquo;n&rsquo;t</i> be sure about the four!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;re as wrong as ever!&rdquo; Bruno
exclaimed triumphantly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just the <i>four</i> I
<i>can</i> be sure about; &rsquo;cause they&rsquo;re here, grubbling
under the window! It&rsquo;s the <i>thousand</i>
I isn&rsquo;t pruffickly sure about!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But some of them have gone into the
sty,&rdquo; Sylvie said, leaning over him to look out
of the window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Bruno; &ldquo;but they went so slowly
and so fewly, I didn&rsquo;t care to count <i>them</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must be going, children,&rdquo; I said.
&ldquo;Wish Bessie good-bye.&rdquo; Sylvie flung her
arms round the little maiden&rsquo;s neck, and kissed
her: but Bruno stood aloof, looking unusually
shy. (&ldquo;I never kiss <i>nobody</i> but Sylvie!&rdquo; he
explained to me afterwards.) The farmer&rsquo;s
wife showed us out: and we were soon on our
way back to Elveston.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that&rsquo;s the new public-house that we
were talking about, I suppose?&rdquo; I said, as
we came in sight of a long low building, with
the words &lsquo;<span class="sc">The Golden Lion</span>&rsquo; over the door.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">79</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s it,&rdquo; said Sylvie. &ldquo;I wonder if
<i>her</i> Willie&rsquo;s inside? Run in, Bruno, and see
if he&rsquo;s there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I interposed, feeling that Bruno was, in a
sort of way, in <i>my</i> care. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not a place
to send a child into.&rdquo; For already the revelers
were getting noisy: and a wild discord of
singing, shouting, and meaningless laughter
came to us through the open windows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They wo&rsquo;n&rsquo;t <i>see</i> him, you know,&rdquo; Sylvie
explained. &ldquo;Wait a minute, Bruno!&rdquo; She
clasped the jewel, that always hung round her
neck, between the palms of her hands, and
muttered a few words to herself. What they
were I could not at all make out, but some
mysterious change seemed instantly to pass
over us. My feet seemed to me no longer to
press the ground, and the dream-like feeling
came upon me, that I was suddenly endowed
with the power of floating in the air. I could
still just <i>see</i> the children: but their forms were
shadowy and unsubstantial, and their voices
sounded as if they came from some distant
place and time, they were so unreal. However,
I offered no further opposition to Bruno&rsquo;s
<span class="pb" id="Page_80">80</span>
going into the house. He was back again in
a few moments. &ldquo;No, he isn&rsquo;t come yet,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re talking about him inside, and
saying how drunk he was last week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While he was speaking, one of the men
lounged out through the door, a pipe in one
hand and a mug of beer in the other, and
crossed to where we were standing, so as to
get a better view along the road. Two or
three others leaned out through the open
window, each holding his mug of beer, with
red faces and sleepy eyes. &ldquo;Canst see him,
lad?&rdquo; one of them asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dunnot know,&rdquo; the man said, taking a
step forwards, which brought us nearly face
to face. Sylvie hastily pulled me out of his
way. &ldquo;Thanks, child,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I had forgotten
he couldn&rsquo;t see us. What would have
happened if I had staid in his way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Sylvie said gravely. &ldquo;It
wouldn&rsquo;t matter to <i>us</i>; but <i>you</i> may be different.&rdquo;
She said this in her usual voice, but
the man took no sort of notice, though she
was standing close in front of him, and looking
up into his face as she spoke.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">81</div>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s coming now!&rdquo; cried Bruno, pointing
down the road.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He be a-coomin noo!&rdquo; echoed the man,
stretching out his arm exactly over Bruno&rsquo;s
head, and pointing with his pipe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then <i>chorus</i> agin!&rdquo; was shouted out by
one of the red-faced men in the window: and
forthwith a dozen voices yelled, to a harsh
discordant melody, the refrain:&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;There&rsquo;s him, an&rsquo; yo&rsquo; an&rsquo; me,</p>
<p class="t5">Roarin&rsquo; laddies!</p>
<p class="t0">We loves a bit o spree,</p>
<p class="t0">Roarin&rsquo; laddies we,</p>
<p class="t5">Roarin&rsquo; laddies</p>
<p class="t5">Roarin&rsquo; laddies!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>The man lounged back again to the house,
joining lustily in the chorus as he went: so
that only the children and I were in the road
when &lsquo;Willie&rsquo; came up.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">82</div>
<h2 id="c6">CHAPTER VI.
<br /><span class="small">WILLIE&rsquo;S WIFE.</span></h2>
<p>He made for the door of the public-house,
but the children intercepted him. Sylvie clung
to one arm; while Bruno, on the opposite
side, was pushing him with all his strength,
with many inarticulate cries of &ldquo;Gee-up! Gee-back!
Woah then!&rdquo; which he had picked up
from the waggoners.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Willie&rsquo; took not the least notice of them:
he was simply conscious that <i>something</i> had
checked him: and, for want of any other way
of accounting for it, he seemed to regard it
as his own act.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">83</div>

<p class="center small">THE RESCUE OF WILLIE</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;I wunnut coom in,&rdquo; he said: &ldquo;not to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A mug o&rsquo; beer wunnut hurt &rsquo;ee!&rdquo; his
friends shouted in chorus. &ldquo;<i>Two</i> mugs wunnut
hurt &rsquo;ee! Nor a dozen mugs!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">84</div>
<p>&ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; said Willie. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m agoan whoam.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, withouten thy drink, Willie man?&rdquo;
shouted the others. But &lsquo;Willie man&rsquo; would
have no more discussion, and turned doggedly
away, the children keeping one on each side of
him, to guard him against any change in his
sudden resolution.</p>
<p>For a while he walked on stoutly enough,
keeping his hands in his pockets, and softly
whistling a tune, in time to his heavy tread:
his success, in appearing entirely at his ease,
was <i>almost</i> complete; but a careful observer
would have noted that he had forgotten the
second part of the air, and that, when it broke
down, he instantly began it again, being too
nervous to think of another, and too restless
to endure silence.</p>
<p>It was not the old fear that possessed him
now&mdash;the old fear, that had been his dreary
companion every Saturday night he could remember,
as he had reeled along, steadying
himself against gates and garden-palings, and
when the shrill reproaches of his wife had
seemed to his dazed brain only the echo of a
yet more piercing voice within, the intolerable
<span class="pb" id="Page_85">85</span>
wail of a hopeless remorse: it was a wholly
new fear that had come to him now: life had
taken on itself a new set of colours, and was
lighted up with a new and dazzling radiance,
and he did not see, as yet, how his home-life,
and his wife and child, would fit into the new
order of things: the very novelty of it all was,
to his simple mind, a perplexity and an overwhelming
terror.</p>
<p>And now the tune died into sudden silence
on the trembling lips, as he turned a sharp
corner, and came in sight of his own cottage,
where his wife stood, leaning with folded arms
on the wicket-gate, and looking up the road
with a pale face, that had in it no glimmer of
the light of hope&mdash;only the heavy shadow of
a deep stony despair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine an&rsquo; early, lad! Fine an&rsquo; early!&rdquo; The
words might have been words of welcoming,
but oh, the bitterness of the tone in which she
said it! &ldquo;What brings thee from thy merry
mates, and all the fiddling and the jigging?
Pockets empty, I doubt? Or thou&rsquo;st come,
mebbe, for to see thy little one die? The
bairnie&rsquo;s clemmed, and I&rsquo;ve nor bite nor sup
<span class="pb" id="Page_86">86</span>
to gie her. But what does <i>thou</i> care?&rdquo; She
flung the gate open, and met him with blazing
eyes of fury.</p>
<p>The man said no word. Slowly, and with
downcast eyes, he passed into the house, while
she, half terrified at his strange silence, followed
him in without another word; and it was not
till he had sunk into a chair, with his arms
crossed on the table and with drooping head,
that she found her voice again.</p>
<p>It seemed entirely natural for us to go in
with them: at another time one would have
asked leave for this, but I felt, I knew not
why, that we were in some mysterious way
invisible, and as free to come and to go as
disembodied spirits.</p>
<p>The child in the cradle woke up, and raised
a piteous cry, which in a moment brought the
children to its side: Bruno rocked the cradle,
while Sylvie tenderly replaced the little head on
the pillow from which it had slipped. But the
mother took no heed of the cry, nor yet of the
satisfied &lsquo;coo&rsquo; that it set up when Sylvie had
made it happy again: she only stood gazing at
her husband, and vainly trying, with white
<span class="pb" id="Page_87">87</span>
quivering lips (I believe she thought he was
mad), to speak in the old tones of shrill upbraiding
that he knew so well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And thou&rsquo;st spent all thy wages&mdash;I&rsquo;ll
swear thou hast&mdash;on the devil&rsquo;s own drink&mdash;and
thou&rsquo;st been and made thysen a beast
again&mdash;as thou allus dost&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hasna!&rdquo; the man muttered, his voice hardly
rising above a whisper, as he slowly emptied
his pockets on the table. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s th&rsquo; wage,
Missus, every penny on&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman gasped, and put one hand to her
heart, as if under some great shock of surprise.
&ldquo;Then <i>how</i>&rsquo;s thee gotten th&rsquo; drink?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Hasna</i> gotten it,&rdquo; he answered her, in a
tone more sad than sullen. &ldquo;I hanna touched
a drop this blessed day. No!&rdquo; he cried aloud,
bringing his clenched fist heavily down upon
the table, and looking up at her with gleaming
eyes, &ldquo;nor I&rsquo;ll never touch another drop o&rsquo; the
cursed drink&mdash;till I die&mdash;so help me God
my Maker!&rdquo; His voice, which had suddenly
risen to a hoarse shout, dropped again as
suddenly: and once more he bowed his head,
and buried his face in his folded arms.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">88</div>

<p class="center small">WILLIE&rsquo;S WIFE</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">89</div>
<p>The woman had dropped upon her knees by
the cradle, while he was speaking. She neither
looked at him nor seemed to hear him. With
hands clasped above her head, she rocked herself
wildly to and fro. &ldquo;Oh my God! Oh my
God!&rdquo; was all she said, over and over again.</p>
<p>Sylvie and Bruno gently unclasped her hands
and drew them down&mdash;till she had an arm
round each of them, though she took no notice
of them, but knelt on with eyes gazing upwards,
and lips that moved as if in silent thanksgiving.
The man kept his face hidden, and uttered no
sound: but one could <i>see</i> the sobs that shook
him from head to foot.</p>
<p>After a while he raised his head&mdash;his face
all wet with tears. &ldquo;Polly!&rdquo; he said softly;
and then, louder, &ldquo;Old Poll!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then she rose from her knees and came to
him, with a dazed look, as if she were walking
in her sleep. &ldquo;Who was it called me
old Poll?&rdquo; she asked: her voice took on it a
tender playfulness: her eyes sparkled; and
the rosy light of Youth flushed her pale cheeks,
till she looked more like a happy girl of seventeen
than a worn woman of forty. &ldquo;Was
<span class="pb" id="Page_90">90</span>
that my own lad, my Willie, a-waiting for me
at the stile?&rdquo;</p>
<p>His face too was transformed, in the same
magic light, to the likeness of a bashful boy:
and boy and girl they seemed, as he wound
an arm about her, and drew her to his side,
while with the other hand he thrust from him
the heap of money, as though it were something
hateful to the touch. &ldquo;Tak it, lass,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;tak it all! An&rsquo; fetch us summat to eat: but
get a sup o&rsquo; milk, first, for t&rsquo; bairn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My <i>little</i> bairn!&rdquo; she murmured as she
gathered up the coins. &ldquo;My own little lassie!&rdquo;
Then she moved to the door, and was passing
out, but a sudden thought seemed to arrest
her: she hastily returned&mdash;first to kneel down
and kiss the sleeping child, and then to throw
herself into her husband&rsquo;s arms and be strained
to his heart. The next moment she was on
her way, taking with her a jug that hung on
a peg near the door: we followed close behind.</p>
<p>We had not gone far before we came in sight
of a swinging sign-board bearing the word
&lsquo;<span class="small">DAIRY</span>&rsquo; on it, and here she went in, welcomed
by a little curly white dog, who, not being
<span class="pb" id="Page_91">91</span>
under the &lsquo;eerie&rsquo; influence, saw the children,
and received them with the most effusive affection.
When I got inside, the dairyman was in
the act of taking the money. &ldquo;Is&rsquo;t for thysen,
Missus, or for t&rsquo; bairn?&rdquo; he asked, when he had
filled the jug, pausing with it in his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For t&rsquo; <i>bairn</i>!&rdquo; she said, almost reproachfully.
&ldquo;Think&rsquo;st tha I&rsquo;d touch a drop <i>mysen</i>,
while as <i>she</i> hadna got her fill?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, Missus,&rdquo; the man replied, turning
away with the jug in his hand. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s just
mak sure it&rsquo;s good measure.&rdquo; He went back
among his shelves of milk-bowls, carefully keeping
his back towards her while he emptied a
little measure of cream into the jug, muttering
to himself &ldquo;mebbe it&rsquo;ll hearten her up a bit,
the little lassie!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman never noticed the kind deed,
but took back the jug with a simple &ldquo;Good
evening, Master,&rdquo; and went her way: but the
children had been more observant, and, as
we followed her out, Bruno remarked &ldquo;That
were <i>welly</i> kind: and I loves that man: and
if I was welly rich I&rsquo;d give him a hundred
pounds&mdash;and a bun. That little grummeling
<span class="pb" id="Page_92">92</span>
dog doosn&rsquo;t know its business!&rdquo; He referred
to the dairyman&rsquo;s little dog, who had apparently
quite forgotten the affectionate welcome he had
given us on our arrival, and was now following
at a respectful distance, doing his best to
&lsquo;<i>speed the parting guest</i>&rsquo; with a shower of
little shrill barks, that seemed to tread on one
another&rsquo;s heels.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What <i>is</i> a dog&rsquo;s business?&rdquo; laughed Sylvie.
&ldquo;Dogs ca&rsquo;n&rsquo;t keep shops and give change!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sisters&rsquo; businesses <i>isn&rsquo;t</i> to laugh at their
brothers,&rdquo; Bruno replied with perfect gravity.
&ldquo;And dogs&rsquo; businesses is to <i>bark</i>&mdash;not like
that: it should finish one bark before it begins
another: and it should&mdash;Oh Sylvie, there&rsquo;s
some dindledums!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And in another moment the happy children
were flying across the common, racing for the
patch of dandelions.</p>
<p>While I stood watching them, a strange
dreamy feeling came upon me: a railway-platform
seemed to take the place of the green
sward, and, instead of the light figure of Sylvie
bounding along, I seemed to see the flying
form of Lady Muriel; but whether Bruno
<span class="pb" id="Page_93">93</span>
had also undergone a transformation, and had
become the old man whom she was running to
overtake, I was unable to judge, so instantaneously
did the feeling come and go.</p>
<p>When I re-entered the little sitting-room
which I shared with Arthur, he was standing
with his back to me, looking out of the open
window, and evidently had not heard me enter.
A cup of tea, apparently just tasted and pushed
aside, stood on the table, on the opposite side of
which was a letter, just begun, with the pen
lying across it: an open book lay on the sofa:
the London paper occupied the easy chair; and
on the little table, which stood by it, I noticed
an unlighted cigar and an open box of cigar-lights:
all things betokened that the Doctor,
usually so methodical and so self-contained, had
been trying every form of occupation, and could
settle to none!</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is very unlike <i>you</i>, Doctor!&rdquo; I was
beginning, but checked myself, as he turned at
the sound of my voice, in sheer amazement at
the wonderful change that had taken place in
his appearance. Never had I seen a face so
radiant with happiness, or eyes that sparkled
<span class="pb" id="Page_94">94</span>
with such unearthly light! &ldquo;Even thus,&rdquo; I
thought, &ldquo;must the herald-angel have looked,
who brought to the shepherds, watching over
their flocks by night, that sweet message of
&lsquo;<i>peace on earth, good-will to men</i>&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, dear friend!&rdquo; he said, as if in answer
to the question that I suppose he read in my
face. &ldquo;It is true! It is true!&rdquo;</p>
<p>No need to ask <i>what</i> was true. &ldquo;God bless
you both!&rdquo; I said, as I felt the happy tears
brimming to my eyes. &ldquo;You were made for
each other!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, simply, &ldquo;I believe we were.
And <i>what</i> a change it makes in one&rsquo;s Life!
This isn&rsquo;t the same world! That isn&rsquo;t the sky
I saw yesterday! Those clouds&mdash;I never
saw such clouds in all my life before! They
look like troops of hovering angels!&rdquo;</p>
<p>To <i>me</i> they looked very ordinary clouds
indeed: but then <i>I</i> had not fed &lsquo;<i>on honey-dew,
And drunk the milk of Paradise</i>&rsquo;!</p>
<p>&ldquo;She wants to see you&mdash;at once,&rdquo; he
continued, descending suddenly to the things
of earth. &ldquo;She says <i>that</i> is the <i>one</i> drop yet
wanting in her cup of happiness!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">95</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go at once,&rdquo; I said, as I turned to leave
the room. &ldquo;Wo&rsquo;n&rsquo;t you come with me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Sir!&rdquo; said the Doctor, with a sudden
effort&mdash;which proved an utter failure&mdash;to
resume his professional manner. &ldquo;Do I <i>look</i>
like coming with you? Have you never heard
that two is company, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I <i>have</i> heard it: and I&rsquo;m
painfully aware that<i> I</i> am <i>Number Three</i>! But,
<i>when</i> shall we three meet again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>When the hurly-burly&rsquo;s done!</i>&rdquo; he answered
with a happy laugh, such as I had not heard
from him for many a year.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">96</div>
<h2 id="c7">CHAPTER VII.
<br /><span class="small">MEIN HERR.</span></h2>
<p>So I went on my lonely way, and, on reaching
the Hall, I found Lady Muriel standing at
the garden-gate waiting for me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No need to <i>give</i> you joy, or to <i>wish</i> you
joy?&rdquo; I began.</p>
<p>&ldquo;None <i>whatever</i>!&rdquo; she replied, with the
joyous laugh of a child. &ldquo;We <i>give</i> people what
they haven&rsquo;t got: we <i>wish</i> for something that
is yet to come. For <i>me</i>, it&rsquo;s all <i>here</i>! It&rsquo;s all
<i>mine</i>! Dear friend,&rdquo; she suddenly broke off,
&ldquo;do you think Heaven ever begins on <i>Earth</i>,
for any of us?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">97</div>
<p>&ldquo;For <i>some</i>,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;For some, perhaps, who
are simple and childlike. You know He said
&lsquo;of such is the Kingdom of Heaven.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lady Muriel clasped her hands, and gazed up
into the cloudless sky, with a look I had often
seen in Sylvie&rsquo;s eyes. &ldquo;I feel as if it had begun
for <i>me</i>,&rdquo; she almost whispered. &ldquo;I feel as if <i>I</i>
were one of the happy children, whom He bid
them bring near to Him, though the people
would have kept them back. Yes, He has seen
me in the throng. He has read the wistful
longing in my eyes. He has beckoned me to
Him. They have <i>had</i> to make way for me.
He has taken me up in His arms. He has put
His hands upon me and blessed me!&rdquo; She
paused, breathless in her perfect happiness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I think He has!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must come and speak to my father,&rdquo;
she went on, as we stood side by side at the
gate, looking down the shady lane. But, even
as she said the words, the &lsquo;eerie&rsquo; sensation
came over me like a flood: I saw the dear
old Professor approaching us, and also saw,
what was stranger still, that he was visible to
<i>Lady Muriel</i>!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">98</div>
<p>What was to be done? Had the fairy-life
been merged in the real life? Or was Lady
Muriel &lsquo;eerie&rsquo; also, and thus able to enter into
the fairy-world along with me? The words
were on my lips (&ldquo;I see an old friend of mine
in the lane: if you don&rsquo;t know him, may I
introduce him to you?&rdquo;) when the strangest
thing of all happened: Lady Muriel spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see an old friend of mine in the lane,&rdquo;
she said: &ldquo;if you don&rsquo;t know him, may I
introduce him to you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I seemed to wake out of a dream: for the
&lsquo;eerie&rsquo; feeling was still strong upon me, and
the figure outside seemed to be changing at
every moment, like one of the shapes in a
kaleidoscope: now he was the <i>Professor</i>, and
now he was somebody else! By the time he
had reached the gate, he certainly was somebody
else: and I felt that the proper course
was for <i>Lady Muriel</i>, not for <i>me</i>, to introduce
him. She greeted him kindly, and, opening
the gate, admitted the venerable old man&mdash;a
German, obviously&mdash;who looked about him
with dazed eyes, as if <i>he</i>, too, had but just
awaked from a dream!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">99</div>
<p>No, it was certainly <i>not</i> the Professor! My
old friend <i>could</i> not have grown that magnificent
beard since last we met: moreover, he
would have recognised <i>me</i>, for I was certain
that <i>I</i> had not changed much in the time.</p>
<p>As it was, he simply looked at me vaguely,
and took off his hat in response to Lady
Muriel&rsquo;s words &ldquo;Let me introduce Mein Herr
to you&rdquo;; while in the words, spoken in a
strong German accent, &ldquo;proud to make your
acquaintance, Sir!&rdquo; I could detect no trace
of an idea that we had ever met before.</p>
<p>Lady Muriel led us to the well-known shady
nook, where preparations for afternoon tea had
already been made, and, while she went in to
look for the Earl, we seated ourselves in two
easy-chairs, and &lsquo;Mein Herr&rsquo; took up Lady
Muriel&rsquo;s work, and examined it through his
large spectacles (one of the adjuncts that
made him so provokingly like the Professor).
&ldquo;Hemming pocket-handkerchiefs?&rdquo; he said,
musingly. &ldquo;So <i>that</i> is what the English
miladies occupy themselves with, is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is the one accomplishment,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;in
which Man has never yet rivaled Woman!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">100</div>
<p>Here Lady Muriel returned with her father;
and, after he had exchanged some friendly
words with &lsquo;Mein Herr,&rsquo; and we had all been
supplied with the needful &lsquo;creature-comforts,&rsquo;
the newcomer returned to the suggestive subject
of Pocket-handkerchiefs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have heard of Fortunatus&rsquo;s Purse,
Miladi? Ah, so! Would you be surprised
to hear that, with three of these leetle handkerchiefs,
you shall make the Purse of Fortunatus,
quite soon, quite easily?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall I indeed?&rdquo; Lady Muriel eagerly
replied, as she took a heap of them into her
lap, and threaded her needle. &ldquo;<i>Please</i> tell
me how, Mein Herr! I&rsquo;ll make one before
I touch another drop of tea!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shall first,&rdquo; said Mein Herr, possessing
himself of two of the handkerchiefs, spreading
one upon the other, and holding them up by
two corners, &ldquo;you shall first join together
these upper corners, the right to the right,
the left to the left; and the opening between
them shall be the <i>mouth</i> of the Purse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A very few stitches sufficed to carry out <i>this</i>
direction. &ldquo;Now, if I sew the other three
<span class="pb" id="Page_101">101</span>
edges together,&rdquo; she suggested, &ldquo;the bag is
complete?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so, Miladi: the <i>lower</i> edges shall <i>first</i>
be joined&mdash;ah, not so!&rdquo; (as she was beginning
to sew them together). &ldquo;Turn one of them
over, and join the <i>right</i> lower corner of the
one to the <i>left</i> lower corner of the other, and
sew the lower edges together in what you
would call <i>the wrong way</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>I</i> see!&rdquo; said Lady Muriel, as she deftly
executed the order. &ldquo;And a very twisted,
uncomfortable, uncanny-looking bag it makes!
But the <i>moral</i> is a lovely one. Unlimited
wealth can only be attained by doing things
<i>in the wrong way</i>! And how are we to join
up these mysterious&mdash;no, I mean <i>this</i> mysterious
opening?&rdquo; (twisting the thing round
and round with a puzzled air.) &ldquo;Yes, it <i>is</i> one
opening. I thought it was <i>two</i>, at first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have seen the puzzle of the Paper
Ring?&rdquo; Mein Herr said, addressing the Earl.
&ldquo;Where you take a slip of paper, and join
its ends together, first twisting one, so as to
join the <i>upper</i> corner of <i>one</i> end to the <i>lower</i>
corner of the <i>other</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">102</div>
<p>&ldquo;I saw one made, only yesterday,&rdquo; the
Earl replied. &ldquo;Muriel, my child, were you
not making one, to amuse those children you
had to tea?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know that Puzzle,&rdquo; said Lady
Muriel. &ldquo;The Ring has only <i>one</i> surface, and
only <i>one</i> edge. It&rsquo;s very mysterious!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The <i>bag</i> is just like that, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; I suggested.
&ldquo;Is not the <i>outer</i> surface of one side
of it continuous with the <i>inner</i> surface of the
other side?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So it is!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;Only it <i>isn&rsquo;t</i>
a bag, just yet. How shall we fill up this
opening, Mein Herr?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thus!&rdquo; said the old man impressively,
taking the bag from her, and rising to his feet
in the excitement of the explanation. &ldquo;The
edge of the opening consists of <i>four</i> handkerchief-edges,
and you can trace it continuously,
round and round the opening: down the
right edge of <i>one</i> handkerchief, up the left edge
of the <i>other</i>, and then down the left edge of
the <i>one</i>, and up the right edge of the <i>other</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you can!&rdquo; Lady Muriel murmured
thoughtfully, leaning her head on her hand,
<span class="pb" id="Page_103">103</span>
and earnestly watching the old man. &ldquo;And
that <i>proves</i> it to be only <i>one</i> opening!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img" id="fig10">
<img src="images/i103.jpg" alt="FORTUNATUS&rsquo; PURSE" width="500" height="363" />
<p class="center small">FORTUNATUS&rsquo; PURSE</p>
</div>
<p>She looked so strangely like a child, puzzling
over a difficult lesson, and Mein Herr had
become, for the moment, so strangely like the
old Professor, that I felt utterly bewildered:
the &lsquo;eerie&rsquo; feeling was on me in its full force,
and I felt almost <i>impelled</i> to say &ldquo;Do you
understand it, Sylvie?&rdquo; However I checked
myself by a great effort, and let the dream
(if indeed it <i>was</i> a dream) go on to its end.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">104</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now, this <i>third</i> handkerchief,&rdquo; Mein Herr
proceeded, &ldquo;has <i>also</i> four edges, which you
can trace continuously round and round: all
you need do is to join its four edges to the
four edges of the opening. The Purse is then
complete, and its outer surface&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>I</i> see!&rdquo; Lady Muriel eagerly interrupted.
&ldquo;Its <i>outer</i> surface will be continuous with its
<i>inner</i> surface! But it will take time. I&rsquo;ll sew
it up after tea.&rdquo; She laid aside the bag and
resumed her cup of tea. &ldquo;But why do you
call it Fortunatus&rsquo;s Purse, Mein Herr?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The dear old man beamed upon her, with a
jolly smile, looking more exactly like the Professor
than ever. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see, my child&mdash;I
should say Miladi? Whatever is <i>inside</i>
that Purse, is <i>outside</i> it; and whatever is <i>outside</i>
it, is <i>inside</i> it. So you have all the
wealth of the world in that leetle Purse!&rdquo;</p>
<p>His pupil clapped her hands, in unrestrained
delight. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll certainly sew the third handkerchief
in&mdash;<i>some</i> time,&rdquo; she said: &ldquo;but I
wo&rsquo;n&rsquo;t take up your time by trying it now.
Tell us some more wonderful things, please!&rdquo;
And her face and her voice so <i>exactly</i> recalled
<span class="pb" id="Page_105">105</span>
Sylvie, that I could not help glancing round,
half-expecting to see <i>Bruno</i> also!</p>
<p>Mein Herr began thoughtfully balancing his
spoon on the edge of his teacup, while he
pondered over this request. &ldquo;Something
wonderful&mdash;like  Fortunatus&rsquo;s Purse? <i>That</i>
will give you&mdash;when it is made&mdash;wealth
beyond your wildest dreams: but it will not
give you <i>Time</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A pause of silence ensued&mdash;utilised by
Lady Muriel for the very practical purpose
of refilling the teacups.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In <i>your</i> country,&rdquo; Mein Herr began with a
startling abruptness, &ldquo;what becomes of all the
wasted Time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lady Muriel looked grave. &ldquo;Who can
tell?&rdquo; she half-whispered to herself. &ldquo;All one
knows is that it is gone&mdash;past recall!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, in <i>my</i>&mdash;I mean in a country <i>I</i> have
visited,&rdquo; said the old man, &ldquo;they store it up:
and it comes in <i>very</i> useful, years afterwards!
For example, suppose you have a long tedious
evening before you: nobody to talk to: nothing
you care to do: and yet hours too soon to go
to bed. How do <i>you</i> behave then?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">106</div>
<p>&ldquo;I get <i>very</i> cross,&rdquo; she frankly admitted:
&ldquo;and I want to throw things about the room!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When that happens to&mdash;to the people I
have visited, they never act <i>so</i>. By a short and
simple process&mdash;which I cannot explain to you&mdash;they
store up the useless hours: and, on
some <i>other</i> occasion, when they happen to <i>need</i>
extra time, they get them out again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Earl was listening with a slightly incredulous
smile. &ldquo;Why cannot you <i>explain</i> the
process?&rdquo; he enquired.</p>
<p>Mein Herr was ready with a quite unanswerable
reason. &ldquo;Because you have no <i>words</i>, in
<i>your</i> language, to convey the ideas which are
needed. I could explain it in&mdash;in&mdash;but you
would not understand it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No indeed!&rdquo; said Lady Muriel, graciously
dispensing with the <i>name</i> of the unknown
language. &ldquo;I never learnt it&mdash;at least, not
to speak it <i>fluently</i>, you know. <i>Please</i> tell us
some more wonderful things!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They run their railway-trains without any
engines&mdash;nothing is needed but machinery to
<i>stop</i> them with. Is <i>that</i> wonderful enough,
Miladi?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">107</div>
<p>&ldquo;But where does the <i>force</i> come from?&rdquo; I
ventured to ask.</p>
<p>Mein Herr turned quickly round, to look at
the new speaker. Then he took off his spectacles,
and polished them, and looked at me
again, in evident bewilderment. I could see
he was thinking&mdash;as indeed <i>I</i> was also&mdash;that
we <i>must</i> have met before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They use the force of <i>gravity</i>,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;It is a force known also in <i>your</i> country, I
believe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that would need a railway going <i>down-hill</i>,&rdquo;
the Earl remarked. &ldquo;You ca&rsquo;n&rsquo;t have <i>all</i>
your railways going down-hill?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They <i>all</i> do,&rdquo; said Mein Herr.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not from <i>both</i> ends?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;From <i>both</i> ends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I give it up!&rdquo; said the Earl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you explain the process?&rdquo; said Lady
Muriel. &ldquo;Without using that language, that I
ca&rsquo;n&rsquo;t speak fluently?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Easily,&rdquo; said Mein Herr. &ldquo;Each railway
is in a long tunnel, perfectly straight: so of
course the <i>middle</i> of it is nearer the centre of
the globe than the two ends: so every train
<span class="pb" id="Page_108">108</span>
runs half-way <i>down</i>-hill, and that gives it force
enough to run the <i>other</i> half <i>up</i>-hill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you. I understand that perfectly,&rdquo;
said Lady Muriel. &ldquo;But the velocity, in the
<i>middle</i> of the tunnel, must be something
<i>fearful</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mein Herr&rsquo; was evidently much gratified
at the intelligent interest Lady Muriel took in
his remarks. At every moment the old man
seemed to grow more chatty and more fluent.
&ldquo;You would like to know our methods of
<i>driving</i>?&rdquo; he smilingly enquired. &ldquo;To us, a
run-away horse is of no import at all!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lady Muriel slightly shuddered. &ldquo;To <i>us</i>
it is a very real danger,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is because your carriage is wholly
<i>behind</i> your horse. Your horse runs. Your
carriage follows. Perhaps your horse has the
bit in his teeth. Who shall stop him? You
fly, ever faster and faster! Finally comes the
inevitable upset!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But suppose <i>your</i> horse manages to get the
bit in his teeth?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No matter! We would not concern ourselves.
Our horse is harnessed in the very
<span class="pb" id="Page_109">109</span>
centre of our carriage. Two wheels are in
front of him, and two behind. To the roof is
attached one end of a broad belt. This goes
under the horse&rsquo;s body, and the other end is
attached to a leetle&mdash;what you call a &lsquo;windlass,&rsquo;
I think. The horse takes the bit in his
teeth. He runs away. We are flying at ten
miles an hour! We turn our little windlass,
five turns, six turns, seven turns, and&mdash;poof!
Our horse is off the ground! <i>Now</i> let him
gallop in the air, as much as he pleases: our
<i>carriage</i> stands still. We sit round him, and
watch him till he is tired. Then we let him
down. Our horse is glad, very much glad,
when his feet once more touch the ground!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Capital!&rdquo; said the Earl, who had been
listening attentively. &ldquo;Are there any other
peculiarities in your carriages?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the <i>wheels</i>, sometimes, my Lord. For
your health, <i>you</i> go to sea: to be pitched, to
be rolled, occasionally to be drowned. <i>We</i> do
all that on land: we are pitched, as you; we
are rolled, as you; but <i>drowned</i>, no! There
is no water!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are the wheels like, then?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">110</div>
<p>&ldquo;They are <i>oval</i>, my Lord. Therefore the
carriages rise and fall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and pitch the carriage backwards and
forwards: but how do they make it <i>roll</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They do not match, my Lord. The <i>end</i> of
one wheel answers to the <i>side</i> of the opposite
wheel. So first one side of the carriage rises,
then the other. And it pitches all the while.
Ah, you must be a good sailor, to drive in our
boat-carriages!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can easily believe it,&rdquo; said the Earl.</p>
<p>Mein Herr rose to his feet. &ldquo;I must leave
you now, Miladi,&rdquo; he said, consulting his watch.
&ldquo;I have another engagement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I only wish we had stored up some extra
time!&rdquo; Lady Muriel said, as she shook hands
with him. &ldquo;Then we could have kept you a
little longer!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In <i>that</i> case I would gladly stay,&rdquo; replied
Mein Herr. &ldquo;As it is&mdash;I fear I must say
good-bye!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did you first meet him?&rdquo; I asked
Lady Muriel, when Mein Herr had left us.
&ldquo;And where does he live? And what is his
real name?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">111</div>
<p>&ldquo;We first&mdash;met&mdash;him&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; she musingly
replied, &ldquo;really, I ca&rsquo;n&rsquo;t remember <i>where</i>!
And I&rsquo;ve no idea where he lives! And I
never heard any other name! It&rsquo;s very
curious. It never occurred to me before to
consider what a mystery he is!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope we shall meet again,&rdquo; I said: &ldquo;he
interests me very much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He will be at our farewell-party, this day
fortnight,&rdquo; said the Earl. &ldquo;Of course you will
come? Muriel is anxious to gather all our
friends around us once more, before we leave
the place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then he explained to me&mdash;as Lady
Muriel had left us together&mdash;that he was so
anxious to get his daughter away from a place
full of so many painful memories connected
with the now-canceled engagement with Major
Lindon, that they had arranged to have the
wedding in a months time, after which Arthur
and his wife were to go on a foreign tour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget Tuesday week!&rdquo; he said as
we shook hands at parting. &ldquo;I only wish you
could bring with you those charming children,
that you introduced to us in the summer.
<span class="pb" id="Page_112">112</span>
Talk of the mystery of Mein Herr! That&rsquo;s
<i>nothing</i> to the mystery that seems to attend
<i>them</i>! I shall never forget those marvellous
flowers!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will bring them if I possibly can,&rdquo; I said.
But how to <i>fulfil</i> such a promise, I mused to
myself on my way back to our lodgings, was
a problem entirely beyond my skill!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">113</div>
<h2 id="c8">CHAPTER VIII.
<br /><span class="small">IN A SHADY PLACE.</span></h2>
<p>The ten days glided swiftly away: and, the
day before the great party was to take place,
Arthur proposed that we should stroll down
to the Hall, in time for afternoon-tea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hadn&rsquo;t you better go <i>alone</i>?&rdquo; I suggested.
&ldquo;Surely <i>I</i> shall be very much <i>de trop</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;ll be a kind of <i>experiment</i>,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;<i>Fiat experimentum in corpore vili!</i>&rdquo;
he added, with a graceful bow of mock politeness
towards the unfortunate victim. &ldquo;You
see I shall have to bear the sight, to-morrow
night, of my lady-love making herself agreable
<span class="pb" id="Page_114">114</span>
to everybody <i>except</i> the right person, and I
shall bear the agony all the better if we have
a dress-rehearsal beforehand!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>My</i> part in the play being, apparently, that
of the sample <i>wrong</i> person?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, no,&rdquo; Arthur said musingly, as we set
forth: &ldquo;there&rsquo;s no such part in a regular
company. &lsquo;Heavy Father&rsquo;? <i>That</i> won&rsquo;t do:
that&rsquo;s filled already. &lsquo;Singing Chambermaid&rsquo;?
Well, the &lsquo;First Lady&rsquo; doubles <i>that</i> part.
&lsquo;Comic Old Man&rsquo;? You&rsquo;re not comic enough.
After all, I&rsquo;m afraid there&rsquo;s no part for you
but the &lsquo;Well-dressed Villain&rsquo;: only,&rdquo; with a
critical side-glance, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a <i>leetle</i> uncertain
about the dress!&rdquo;</p>
<p>We found Lady Muriel alone, the Earl
having gone out to make a call, and at once
resumed old terms of intimacy, in the shady
arbour where the tea-things seemed to be
always waiting. The only novelty in the
arrangements (one which Lady Muriel seemed
to regard as <i>entirely</i> a matter of course), was
that two of the chairs were placed <i>quite</i> close
together, side by side. Strange to say, <i>I</i> was
not invited to occupy <i>either</i> of them!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">115</div>
<p>&ldquo;We have been arranging, as we came
along, about letter-writing,&rdquo; Arthur began.
&ldquo;He will want to know how we&rsquo;re enjoying
our Swiss tour: and of course we must pretend
we <i>are</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; she meekly assented.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the skeleton-in-the-cupboard&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; I
suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&mdash;is always a difficulty,&rdquo; she quickly put
in, &ldquo;when you&rsquo;re traveling about, and when
there are no cupboards in the hotels. However,
<i>ours</i> is a <i>very</i> portable one; and will be
neatly packed, in a nice leather case&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But please don&rsquo;t think about <i>writing</i>,&rdquo; I
said, &ldquo;when you&rsquo;ve anything more attractive
on hand. I delight in <i>reading</i> letters, but I
know well how tiring it is to <i>write</i> them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It <i>is</i>, sometimes,&rdquo; Arthur assented. &ldquo;For
instance, when you&rsquo;re very shy of the person
you have to write to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does that show itself in the <i>letter</i>?&rdquo; Lady
Muriel enquired. &ldquo;Of course, when I hear
any one <i>talking</i>&mdash;<i>you</i>, for instance&mdash;I can
see how <i>desperately</i> shy he is! But can you
see that in a <i>letter</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">116</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, of course, when you hear any one
talk <i>fluently</i>&mdash;<i>you</i>, for instance&mdash;you can see
how desperately <i>un</i>-shy she is&mdash;not to say
saucy! But the shyest and most intermittent
talker must <i>seem</i> fluent in letter-writing. He
may have taken half-an-hour to <i>compose</i> his
second sentence; but there it is, close after
the first!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then letters don&rsquo;t express all that they
<i>might</i> express?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s merely because our system of letter-writing
is incomplete. A shy writer <i>ought</i> to
be able to show that he is so. Why shouldn&rsquo;t
he make <i>pauses</i> in writing, just as he would
do in speaking? He might leave blank spaces&mdash;say
half a page at a time. And a <i>very</i> shy
girl&mdash;if there <i>is</i> such a thing&mdash;might write
a sentence on the <i>first</i> sheet of her letter&mdash;then
put in a couple of <i>blank</i> sheets&mdash;then
a sentence on the <i>fourth</i> sheet: and so on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I quite foresee that <i>we</i>&mdash;I mean this clever
little boy and myself&mdash;&rdquo; Lady Muriel said to
me, evidently with the kind wish to bring me
into the conversation, &ldquo;&mdash;are going to become
famous&mdash;of course all our inventions are
<span class="pb" id="Page_117">117</span>
common property now&mdash;for a new Code of
Rules for Letter-writing! Please invent some
more, little boy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, another thing <i>greatly</i> needed, little
girl, is some way of expressing that we <i>don&rsquo;t</i>
mean anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Explain yourself, little boy! Surely <i>you</i>
can find no difficulty in expressing a <i>total</i>
absence of meaning?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean that you should be able, when you
<i>don&rsquo;t</i> mean a thing to be taken seriously, to
express that wish. For human nature is so
constituted that whatever you write seriously
is taken as a joke, and whatever you mean
as a joke is taken seriously! At any rate, it
is so in writing to a <i>lady</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! you&rsquo;re not used to writing to ladies!&rdquo;
Lady Muriel remarked, leaning back in her
chair, and gazing thoughtfully into the sky.
&ldquo;You should try.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very good,&rdquo; said Arthur. &ldquo;How many
ladies may I begin writing to? As many as I
can count on the fingers of both hands?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As many as you can count on the <i>thumbs</i>
of <i>one</i> hand!&rdquo; his lady-love replied with much
<span class="pb" id="Page_118">118</span>
severity. &ldquo;What a <i>very</i> naughty little boy he
is! <i>Isn&rsquo;t</i> he?&rdquo; (with an appealing glance at
me).</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a little fractious,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Perhaps
he&rsquo;s cutting a tooth.&rdquo; While to myself I said
&ldquo;How <i>exactly</i> like Sylvie talking to Bruno!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He wants his tea.&rdquo; (The naughty little boy
volunteered the information.) &ldquo;He&rsquo;s getting
very tired, at the mere <i>prospect</i> of the great
party to-morrow!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then he shall have a good rest beforehand!&rdquo;
she soothingly replied. &ldquo;The tea isn&rsquo;t
made yet. Come, little boy, lean well back in
your chair, and think about nothing&mdash;or about
<i>me</i>, whichever you prefer!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the same, all the same!&rdquo; Arthur sleepily
murmured, watching her with loving eyes,
as she moved her chair away to the tea table,
and began to make the tea. &ldquo;Then he&rsquo;ll wait
for his tea, like a good, patient little boy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall I bring you the London Papers?&rdquo;
said Lady Muriel. &ldquo;I saw them lying on the
table as I came out, but my father said there
was nothing in them, except that horrid murder-trial.&rdquo;
(Society was just then enjoying its daily
<span class="pb" id="Page_119">119</span>
thrill of excitement in studying the details of a
specially sensational murder in a thieves&rsquo; den in
the East of London.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have no appetite for horrors,&rdquo; Arthur
replied. &ldquo;But I hope we have learned the
lesson they should teach us&mdash;though we are
very apt to read it backwards!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img" id="fig11">
<img src="images/i119.jpg" alt="&lsquo;I AM SITTING AT YOUR FEET&rsquo;" width="500" height="358" />
<p class="center small">&lsquo;I AM SITTING AT YOUR FEET&rsquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;You speak in riddles,&rdquo; said Lady Muriel.
&ldquo;Please explain yourself. See now,&rdquo; suiting
the action to the word, &ldquo;I am sitting at your
feet, just as if you were a second Gamaliel!
<span class="pb" id="Page_120">120</span>
Thanks, no.&rdquo; (This was to me, who had risen
to bring her chair back to its former place.)
&ldquo;Pray don&rsquo;t disturb yourself. This tree and
the grass make a very nice easy-chair. <i>What</i> is
the lesson that one always reads wrong?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Arthur was silent for a minute. &ldquo;I would
like to be clear what it <i>is</i> I mean,&rdquo; he said,
slowly and thoughtfully, &ldquo;before I say anything
to <i>you</i>&mdash;because you <i>think</i> about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Anything approaching to a compliment was
so unusual an utterance for Arthur, that it
brought a flush of pleasure to her cheek, as she
replied &ldquo;It is <i>you</i>, that give me the ideas to
think about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One&rsquo;s first thought,&rdquo; Arthur proceeded, &ldquo;in
reading of anything specially vile or barbarous,
as done by a fellow-creature, is apt to be that
we see a new depth of Sin revealed <i>beneath</i> us:
and we seem to gaze down into that abyss from
some higher ground, far apart from it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I understand you now. You mean
that one ought to think&mdash;not &lsquo;God, I thank
Thee that I am not as other men are&rsquo;&mdash;but
&lsquo;God, be merciful to me also, who might be,
but for Thy grace, a sinner as vile as he!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">121</div>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Arthur. &ldquo;I meant a great deal
more than that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked up quickly, but checked herself,
and waited in silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One must begin further back, I think.
Think of some other man, the same age as this
poor wretch. Look back to the time when
they both began life&mdash;before they had sense
enough to know Right from Wrong. <i>Then</i>, at
any rate, they were equal in God&rsquo;s sight?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She nodded assent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have, then, two distinct epochs at which
we may contemplate the two men whose lives
we are comparing. At the first epoch they are,
so far as moral responsibility is concerned, on
precisely the same footing: they are alike
incapable of doing right or wrong. At the
second epoch the one man&mdash;I am taking an
extreme case, for contrast&mdash;has won the esteem
and love of all around him: his character is
stainless, and his name will be held in honour
hereafter: the other man&rsquo;s history is one
unvaried record of crime, and his life is at last
forfeited to the outraged laws of his country.
Now what have been the causes, in each case,
<span class="pb" id="Page_122">122</span>
of each man&rsquo;s condition being what it is at the
second epoch? They are of two kinds&mdash;one
acting from within, the other from without.
These two kinds need to be discussed separately&mdash;that
is, if I have not already tired you
with my prosing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the contrary,&rdquo; said Lady Muriel, &ldquo;it is
a special delight to me to have a question
discussed in this way&mdash;analysed and arranged,
so that one can understand it. Some books,
that profess to argue out a question, are to me
intolerably wearisome, simply because the ideas
are all arranged hap-hazard&mdash;a sort of &lsquo;first
come, first served.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are very encouraging,&rdquo; Arthur replied,
with a pleased look. &ldquo;The causes, acting from
<i>within</i>, which make a man&rsquo;s character what it is
at any given moment, are his successive acts of
volition&mdash;that is, his acts of choosing whether
he will do this or that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are to assume the existence of Free-Will?&rdquo;
I said, in order to have that point made
quite clear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If not,&rdquo; was the quiet reply, &ldquo;<i>cadit
quaestio</i>: and I have no more to say.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">123</div>
<p>&ldquo;We <i>will</i> assume it!&rdquo; the rest of the
audience&mdash;the majority, I may say, looking at
it from Arthur&rsquo;s point of view&mdash;imperiously
proclaimed. The orator proceeded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The causes, acting from <i>without</i>, are his
surroundings&mdash;what Mr. Herbert Spencer
calls his &lsquo;environment.&rsquo; Now the point I want
to make clear is this, that a man is responsible
for his acts of choosing, but <i>not</i> responsible
for his environment. Hence, if these two men
make, on some given occasion, when they are
exposed to equal temptation, equal efforts to
resist and to choose the right, their condition,
in the sight of God, must be the same. If He
is pleased in the one case, so will He be in the
other; if displeased in the one case, so also in
the other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is so, no doubt: I see it quite clearly,&rdquo;
Lady Muriel put in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet, owing to their different environments,
the one may win a great victory over the
temptation, while the other falls into some black
abyss of crime.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But surely you would not say those men
were equally guilty in the sight of God?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">124</div>
<p>&ldquo;Either that,&rdquo; said Arthur, &ldquo;or else I must
give up my belief in God&rsquo;s perfect justice.
But let me put one more case, which will show
my meaning even more forcibly. Let the one
man be in a high social position&mdash;the other,
say, a common thief. Let the one be tempted
to some trivial act of unfair dealing&mdash;something
which he can do with the absolute
certainty that it will never be discovered&mdash;something
which he can with perfect ease
forbear from doing&mdash;and which he distinctly
knows to be a sin. Let the other be tempted
to some terrible crime&mdash;as men would consider
it&mdash;but under an almost overwhelming pressure
of motives&mdash;of course not <i>quite</i> overwhelming,
as that would destroy all responsibility. Now,
in this case, let the second man make a <i>greater</i>
effort at resistance than the first. Also suppose
<i>both</i> to fall under the temptation&mdash;I say that
the second man is, in God&rsquo;s sight, <i>less</i> guilty
than the other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lady Muriel drew a long breath. &ldquo;It upsets
all one&rsquo;s ideas of Right and Wrong&mdash;just at
first! Why, in that dreadful murder-trial, you
would say, I suppose, that it was possible that
<span class="pb" id="Page_125">125</span>
the least guilty man in the Court was the
murderer, and that possibly the judge who
tried him, by yielding to the temptation of
making one unfair remark, had committed a
crime outweighing the criminal&rsquo;s whole career!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly I should,&rdquo; Arthur firmly replied.
&ldquo;It sounds like a paradox, I admit. But just
think what a grievous sin it must be, in God&rsquo;s
sight, to yield to some very slight temptation,
which we could have resisted with perfect ease,
and to do it deliberately, and in the full light
of God&rsquo;s Law. What penance can atone for
a sin like <i>that</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ca&rsquo;n&rsquo;t reject your theory,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;But
how it seems to widen the possible area of Sin
in the world!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that so?&rdquo; Lady Muriel anxiously
enquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, not so, not so!&rdquo; was the eager reply.
&ldquo;To me it seems to clear away much of the
cloud that hangs over the world&rsquo;s history.
When this view first made itself clear to me,
I remember walking out into the fields, repeating
to myself that line of Tennyson &lsquo;<i>There
seemed no room for sense of wrong!</i>&rsquo; The
<span class="pb" id="Page_126">126</span>
thought, that perhaps the real guilt of the
human race was infinitely less than I fancied
it&mdash;that the millions, whom I had thought of
as sunk in hopeless depths of sin, were perhaps,
in God&rsquo;s sight, scarcely sinning at all&mdash;was
more sweet than words can tell! Life
seemed more bright and beautiful, when once
that thought had come! &lsquo;<i>A livelier emerald
twinkles in the grass, A purer sapphire melts
into the sea!</i>&rsquo;&rdquo; His voice trembled as he
concluded, and the tears stood in his eyes.</p>
<p>Lady Muriel shaded her face with her hand,
and was silent for a minute. &ldquo;It is a beautiful
thought,&rdquo; she said, looking up at last. &ldquo;Thank
you&mdash;Arthur, for putting it into my head!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Earl returned in time to join us at tea,
and to give us the very unwelcome tidings that
a fever had broken out in the little harbour-town
that lay below us&mdash;a fever of so malignant
a type that, though it had only appeared a
day or two ago, there were already more than
a dozen down in it, two or three of whom were
reported to be in imminent danger.</p>
<p>In answer to the eager questions of Arthur&mdash;who
of course took a deep scientific interest
<span class="pb" id="Page_127">127</span>
in the matter&mdash;he could give very few <i>technical</i>
details, though he had met the local doctor. It
appeared, however, that it was an almost <i>new</i>
disease&mdash;at least in <i>this</i> century, though it
<i>might</i> prove to be identical with the &lsquo;Plague&rsquo;
recorded in History&mdash;<i>very</i> infectious, and
frightfully rapid in its action. &ldquo;It will not,
however, prevent our party to-morrow,&rdquo; he
said in conclusion. &ldquo;None of the guests belong
to the infected district, which is, as you
know, exclusively peopled by fishermen: so
you may come without any fear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Arthur was very silent, all the way back,
and, on reaching our lodgings, immediately
plunged into medical studies, connected with
the alarming malady of whose arrival we had
just heard.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">128</div>
<h2 id="c9">CHAPTER IX.
<br /><span class="small">THE FAREWELL-PARTY.</span></h2>
<p>On the following day, Arthur and I reached
the Hall in good time, as only a few of the
guests&mdash;it was to be a party of eighteen&mdash;had
as yet arrived; and these were talking with
the Earl, leaving us the opportunity of a few
words apart with our hostess.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is that <i>very</i> learned-looking man with
the large spectacles?&rdquo; Arthur enquired. &ldquo;I
haven&rsquo;t met him here before, have I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, he&rsquo;s a new friend of ours,&rdquo; said Lady
Muriel: &ldquo;a German, I believe. He <i>is</i> such a
dear old thing! And quite the most learned
<span class="pb" id="Page_129">129</span>
man I ever met&mdash;with <i>one</i> exception, of
course!&rdquo; she added humbly, as Arthur drew
himself up with an air of offended dignity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the young lady in blue, just beyond
him, talking to that foreign-looking man. Is
<i>she</i> learned, too?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Lady Muriel. &ldquo;But
I&rsquo;m told she&rsquo;s a wonderful piano-forte-player. I
hope you&rsquo;ll hear her to-night. I asked that
foreigner to take her in, because <i>he&rsquo;s</i> very
musical, too. He&rsquo;s a French Count, I believe;
and he sings <i>splendidly</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Science&mdash;music&mdash;singing&mdash;you have indeed
got a complete party!&rdquo; said Arthur. &ldquo;I
feel quite a privileged person, meeting all these
stars. I <i>do</i> love music!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the party isn&rsquo;t <i>quite</i> complete!&rdquo; said
Lady Muriel. &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t brought us those
two beautiful children,&rdquo; she went on, turning
to me. &ldquo;He brought them here to tea, you
know, one day last summer,&rdquo; again addressing
Arthur; &ldquo;and they <i>are</i> such darlings!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are, <i>indeed</i>,&rdquo; I assented.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why haven&rsquo;t you brought them with
you? You promised my father you <i>would</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">130</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very sorry,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;but really it was
impossible to bring them with me.&rdquo; Here I
most certainly <i>meant</i> to conclude the sentence:
and it was with a feeling of utter amazement,
which I cannot adequately describe, that I
heard myself <i>going on speaking</i>. &ldquo;&mdash;but they
are to join me here in the course of the evening&rdquo;
were the words, uttered in <i>my</i> voice, and
seeming to come from <i>my</i> lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m <i>so</i> glad!&rdquo; Lady Muriel joyfully replied.
&ldquo;I <i>shall</i> enjoy introducing them to some of my
friends here! When do you expect them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I took refuge in silence. The only <i>honest</i>
reply would have been &ldquo;That was not <i>my</i>
remark. <i>I</i> didn&rsquo;t say it, and <i>it isn&rsquo;t true</i>!&rdquo;
But I had not the moral courage to make such
a confession. The character of a &lsquo;lunatic&rsquo; is
not, I believe, very difficult to <i>acquire</i>: but it
is amazingly difficult to <i>get rid of</i>: and it
seemed quite certain that any such speech as
<i>that</i> would <i>quite</i> justify the issue of a writ &lsquo;<i>de
lunatico inquirendo</i>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Lady Muriel evidently thought I had failed
to hear her question, and turned to Arthur
with a remark on some other subject; and I
<span class="pb" id="Page_131">131</span>
had time to recover from my shock of surprise&mdash;or
to awake out of my momentary &lsquo;eerie&rsquo;
condition, whichever it was.</p>
<p>When things around me seemed once more
to be real, Arthur was saying &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid
there&rsquo;s no help for it: they <i>must</i> be finite in
number.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should be sorry to have to believe it,&rdquo;
said Lady Muriel. &ldquo;Yet, when one comes to
think of it, there <i>are</i> no new melodies, now-a-days.
What people talk of as &lsquo;the last new
song&rsquo; always recalls to <i>me</i> some tune I&rsquo;ve
known as a child!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The day must come&mdash;if the world lasts
long enough&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; said Arthur, &ldquo;when every
possible tune will have been composed&mdash;every
possible pun perpetrated&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; (Lady Muriel
wrung her hands, like a tragedy-queen) &ldquo;and,
worse than that, every possible <i>book</i> written!
For the number of <i>words</i> is finite.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll make very little difference to the
<i>authors</i>,&rdquo; I suggested. &ldquo;Instead of saying
&lsquo;<i>what</i> book shall I write?&rsquo; an author will ask
himself &lsquo;<i>which</i> book shall I write?&rsquo; A mere
verbal distinction!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">132</div>
<p>Lady Muriel gave me an approving smile.
&ldquo;But <i>lunatics</i> would always write new books,
surely?&rdquo; she went on. &ldquo;They <i>couldn&rsquo;t</i> write
the sane books over again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True,&rdquo; said Arthur. &ldquo;But <i>their</i> books
would come to an end, also. The number of
lunatic <i>books</i> is as finite as the number of
lunatics.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And <i>that</i> number is becoming greater
every year,&rdquo; said a pompous man, whom I
recognised as the self-appointed showman on
the day of the picnic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So they say,&rdquo; replied Arthur. &ldquo;And, when
ninety per cent. of us are lunatics,&rdquo; (he seemed
to be in a wildly nonsensical mood) &ldquo;the
asylums will be put to their proper use.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that is&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo; the pompous man
gravely enquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>To shelter the sane!</i>&rdquo; said Arthur. &ldquo;<i>We</i>
shall bar ourselves in. The lunatics will have
it all their own way, <i>outside</i>. They&rsquo;ll do it
a little queerly, no doubt. Railway-collisions
will be always happening: steamers always
blowing up: most of the towns will be burnt
down: most of the ships sunk&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">133</div>
<p>&ldquo;And most of the men <i>killed</i>!&rdquo; murmured
the pompous man, who was evidently hopelessly
bewildered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; Arthur assented. &ldquo;Till at last
there will be <i>fewer</i> lunatics than sane men.
Then <i>we</i> come out: <i>they</i> go in: and things
return to their normal condition!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The pompous man frowned darkly, and bit
his lip, and folded his arms, vainly trying to
think it out. &ldquo;He is <i>jesting</i>!&rdquo; he muttered
to himself at last, in a tone of withering contempt,
as he stalked away.</p>
<p>By this time the other guests had arrived;
and dinner was announced. Arthur of course
took down Lady Muriel: and <i>I</i> was pleased
to find myself seated at her other side, with
a severe-looking old lady (whom I had not
met before, and whose name I had, as is usual
in introductions, entirely failed to catch, merely
gathering that it sounded like a compound-name)
as my partner for the banquet.</p>
<p>She appeared, however, to be acquainted
with Arthur, and confided to me in a low voice
her opinion that he was &ldquo;a very argumentative
young man.&rdquo; Arthur, for his part, seemed well
<span class="pb" id="Page_134">134</span>
inclined to show himself worthy of the character
she had given him, and, hearing her say &ldquo;I
never take wine with my soup!&rdquo; (this was <i>not</i>
a confidence to me, but was launched upon
Society, as a matter of general interest), he
at once challenged a combat by asking her
&ldquo;<i>when</i> would you say that property <i>commence</i>
in a plate of soup?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is <i>my</i> soup,&rdquo; she sternly replied:
&ldquo;and what is before you is <i>yours</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No doubt,&rdquo; said Arthur: &ldquo;but <i>when</i> did I
begin to own it? Up to the moment of its
being put into the plate, it was the property
of our host: while being offered round the
table, it was, let us say, held in trust by the
waiter: did it become mine when I accepted
it? Or when it was placed before me? Or
when I took the first spoonful?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is a <i>very</i> argumentative young man!&rdquo;
was all the old lady would say: but she said
it audibly, this time, feeling that Society had a
right to know it.</p>
<p>Arthur smiled mischievously. &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t
mind betting you a shilling,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that the
Eminent Barrister next you&rdquo; (It certainly <i>is</i>
<span class="pb" id="Page_135">135</span>
possible to say words so as to make them
begin with capitals!) &ldquo;ca&rsquo;n&rsquo;t answer me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I <i>never</i> bet,&rdquo; she sternly replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not even sixpenny points at <i>whist</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Never!</i>&rdquo; she repeated. &ldquo;<i>Whist</i> is innocent
enough: but whist played for <i>money</i>!&rdquo;
She shuddered.</p>
<p>Arthur became serious again. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I
ca&rsquo;n&rsquo;t take that view,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I consider
that the introduction of small stakes for card-playing
was one of the most <i>moral</i> acts Society
ever did, <i>as</i> Society.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How was it so?&rdquo; said Lady Muriel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because it took Cards, once for all, out of
the category of games at which <i>cheating</i> is possible.
Look at the way Croquet is demoralising
Society. Ladies are beginning to cheat at it,
terribly: and, if they&rsquo;re found out, they only
laugh, and call it fun. But when there&rsquo;s <i>money</i>
at stake, that is out of the question. The
swindler is <i>not</i> accepted as a wit. When a
man sits down to cards, and cheats his friends
out of their money, he doesn&rsquo;t get much <i>fun</i>
out of it&mdash;unless he thinks it fun to be kicked
down stairs!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">136</div>
<p>&ldquo;If all gentlemen thought as badly of ladies
as <i>you</i> do,&rdquo; my neighbour remarked with some
bitterness, &ldquo;there would be very few&mdash;very
few&mdash;&mdash;.&rdquo; She seemed doubtful how to end
her sentence, but at last took &ldquo;honeymoons&rdquo;
as a safe word.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the contrary,&rdquo; said Arthur, the mischievous
smile returning to his face, &ldquo;if only
people would adopt <i>my</i> theory, the number of
honeymoons&mdash;quite of a new kind&mdash;would
be greatly increased!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May we hear about this new kind of
honeymoon?&rdquo; said Lady Muriel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let <i>X</i> be the gentleman,&rdquo; Arthur began, in
a slightly raised voice, as he now found himself
with an audience of <i>six</i>, including &lsquo;Mein Herr,&rsquo;
who was seated at the other side of my polynomial
partner. &ldquo;Let <i>X</i> be the gentleman,
and <i>Y</i> the lady to whom he thinks of proposing.
He applies for an Experimental Honeymoon.
It is granted. Forthwith the young couple&mdash;accompanied
by the great-aunt of <i>Y</i>, to act as
chaperone&mdash;start for a month&rsquo;s tour, during
which they have many a moonlight-walk, and
many a <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i> conversation, and each can
<span class="pb" id="Page_137">137</span>
form a more correct estimate of the other&rsquo;s
character, in four <i>weeks</i>, than would have been
possible in as many <i>years</i>, when meeting under
the ordinary restrictions of Society. And it is
only after their <i>return</i> that <i>X</i> finally decides
whether he will, or will not, put the momentous
question to <i>Y</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In nine cases out of ten,&rdquo; the pompous man
proclaimed, &ldquo;he would decide to break it off!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, in nine cases out of ten,&rdquo; Arthur
rejoined, &ldquo;an unsuitable match would be prevented,
and <i>both</i> parties saved from misery!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The only really <i>unsuitable</i> matches,&rdquo; the
old lady remarked, &ldquo;are those made without
sufficient <i>Money</i>. Love may come <i>afterwards</i>.
Money is needed <i>to begin with</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This remark was cast loose upon Society, as
a sort of general challenge; and, as such, it was
at once accepted by several of those within
hearing: <i>Money</i> became the key-note of the
conversation for some time; and a fitful echo of
it was again heard, when the dessert had been
placed upon the table, the servants had left the
room, and the Earl had started the wine in
its welcome progress round the table.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">138</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very glad to see you keep up the old
customs,&rdquo; I said to Lady Muriel as I filled her
glass. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s really delightful to experience,
once more, the peaceful feeling that comes over
one when the waiters have left the room&mdash;when
one can converse without the feeling of
being overheard, and without having dishes
constantly thrust over one&rsquo;s shoulder. How
much more sociable it is to be able to pour
out the wine for the ladies, and to hand the
dishes to those who wish for them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In that case, kindly send those peaches
down here,&rdquo; said a fat red-faced man, who was
seated beyond our pompous friend. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
been wishing for them&mdash;diagonally&mdash;for some
time!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it <i>is</i> a ghastly innovation,&rdquo; Lady
Muriel replied, &ldquo;letting the waiters carry round
the wine at dessert. For one thing, they
<i>always</i> take it the wrong way round&mdash;which of
course brings bad luck to <i>everybody</i> present!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better go the <i>wrong</i> way than not go <i>at
all</i>!&rdquo; said our host. &ldquo;Would you kindly help
yourself?&rdquo; (This was to the fat red-faced
man.) &ldquo;You are not a teetotaler, I think?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">139</div>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed but I <i>am</i>!&rdquo; he replied, as he
pushed on the bottles. &ldquo;Nearly twice as
much money is spent in England on <i>Drink</i>,
as on any other article of food. Read this
card.&rdquo; (What faddist ever goes about without
a pocketful of the appropriate literature?)
&ldquo;The stripes of different colours represent the
amounts spent on various articles of food.
Look at the highest three. Money spent on
butter and on cheese, thirty-five millions: on
bread, seventy millions: on <i>intoxicating liquors</i>,
one hundred and thirty-six millions! If I
had my way, I would close every public-house
in the land! Look at that card, and read the
motto. <i>That&rsquo;s where all the money goes to!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you seen the <i>Anti-Teetotal Card</i>?&rdquo;
Arthur innocently enquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Sir, I have not!&rdquo; the orator savagely
replied. &ldquo;What is it like?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Almost exactly like this one. The coloured
stripes are the same. Only, instead of the
words &lsquo;Money spent on,&rsquo; it has &lsquo;Incomes
derived from sale of&rsquo;; and, instead of &lsquo;That&rsquo;s
where all the money goes to,&rsquo; its motto is
&lsquo;<i>That&rsquo;s where all the money comes from!</i>&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">140</div>
<p>The red-faced man scowled, but evidently
considered Arthur beneath his notice. So
Lady Muriel took up the cudgels. &ldquo;Do you
hold the theory,&rdquo; she enquired, &ldquo;that people
can preach teetotalism more effectually by being
teetotalers themselves?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly I do!&rdquo; replied the red-faced man.
&ldquo;Now, here is a case in point,&rdquo; unfolding
a newspaper-cutting: &ldquo;let me read you this
letter from a teetotaler. <i>To the Editor.
Sir, I was once a moderate drinker, and knew
a man who drank to excess. I went to him.
&lsquo;Give up this drink,&rsquo; I said. &lsquo;It will ruin your
health!&rsquo; &lsquo;You drink,&rsquo; he said: &lsquo;why shouldn&rsquo;t
I?&rsquo; &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;but I know when to
leave off.&rsquo; He turned away from me. &lsquo;You
drink in your way,&rsquo; he said: &lsquo;let me drink
in mine. Be off!&rsquo; Then I saw that, to do
any good with him, I must forswear drink.
From that hour I haven&rsquo;t touched a drop!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There! What do you say to <i>that</i>?&rdquo; He
looked round triumphantly, while the cutting
was handed round for inspection.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How very curious!&rdquo; exclaimed Arthur,
when it had reached him. &ldquo;Did you happen
<span class="pb" id="Page_141">141</span>
to see a letter, last week, about early rising?
It was strangely like this one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The red-faced man&rsquo;s curiosity was roused.
&ldquo;Where did it appear?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me read it to you,&rdquo; said Arthur. He
took some papers from his pocket, opened one
of them, and read as follows. &ldquo;<i>To the Editor.
Sir, I was once a moderate sleeper, and knew a
man who slept to excess. I pleaded with him.
&lsquo;Give up this lying in bed,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;It will
ruin your health!&rsquo; &lsquo;You go to bed,&rsquo; he said:
&lsquo;why shouldn&rsquo;t I?&rsquo; &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;but I know
when to get up in the morning.&rsquo; He turned away
from me. &lsquo;You sleep in your way,&rsquo; he said:
&lsquo;let me sleep in mine. Be off!&rsquo; Then I saw
that to do any good with him, I must forswear
sleep. From that hour I haven&rsquo;t been to bed!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Arthur folded and pocketed his paper, and
passed on the newspaper-cutting. None of us
dared to laugh, the red-faced man was
evidently so angry. &ldquo;Your parallel doesn&rsquo;t run
on all fours!&rdquo; he snarled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Moderate</i> drinkers never do so!&rdquo; Arthur
quietly replied. Even the stern old lady
laughed at this.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">142</div>
<p>&ldquo;But it needs many other things to make a
<i>perfect</i> dinner!&rdquo; said Lady Muriel, evidently
anxious to change the subject. &ldquo;Mein Herr!
What is <i>your</i> idea of a perfect dinner-party?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man looked round smilingly, and
his gigantic spectacles seemed more gigantic
than ever. &ldquo;A <i>perfect</i> dinner-party?&rdquo; he
repeated. &ldquo;First, it must be presided over
by our present hostess!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That, of <i>course</i>!&rdquo; she gaily interposed.
&ldquo;But what <i>else</i>, Mein Herr?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can but tell you what I have seen,&rdquo; said
Mein Herr, &ldquo;in mine own&mdash;in the country I
have traveled in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He paused for a full minute, and gazed
steadily at the ceiling&mdash;with so dreamy an
expression on his face, that I feared he was
going off into a reverie, which seemed to be
his normal state. However, after a minute,
he suddenly began again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That which chiefly causes the failure of a
dinner-party, is the running-short&mdash;not of meat,
nor yet of drink, but of <i>conversation</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In an <i>English</i> dinner-party,&rdquo; I remarked,
&ldquo;I have never known <i>small-talk</i> run short!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">143</div>
<p>&ldquo;Pardon me,&rdquo; Mein Herr respectfully replied,
&ldquo;I did not say &lsquo;small-talk.&rsquo; I said &lsquo;conversation.&rsquo;
All such topics as the weather, or politics,
or local gossip, are unknown among us. They
are either vapid or controversial. What we
need for <i>conversation</i> is a topic of <i>interest</i> and
of <i>novelty</i>. To secure these things we have
tried various plans&mdash;Moving-Pictures, Wild-Creatures,
Moving-Guests, and a Revolving-Humorist.
But this last is only adapted to
<i>small</i> parties.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us have it in four separate Chapters,
please!&rdquo; said Lady Muriel, who was evidently
deeply interested&mdash;as, indeed, most of the
party were, by this time: and, all down the
table, talk had ceased, and heads were leaning
forwards, eager to catch fragments of Mein
Herr&rsquo;s oration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chapter One! Moving-Pictures!&rdquo; was proclaimed
in the silvery voice of our hostess.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The dining-table is shaped like a circular
ring,&rdquo; Mein Herr began, in low dreamy tones,
which, however, were perfectly audible in the
silence. &ldquo;The guests are seated at the inner
side as well as the outer, having ascended to
<span class="pb" id="Page_144">144</span>
their places by a winding-staircase, from the
room below. Along the middle of the table
runs a little railway; and there is an endless
train of trucks, worked round by machinery;
and on each truck there are two pictures, leaning
back to back. The train makes two circuits
during dinner; and, when it has been <i>once</i>
round, the waiters turn the pictures round in
each truck, making them face the other way.
Thus <i>every</i> guest sees <i>every</i> picture!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He paused, and the silence seemed deader
than ever. Lady Muriel looked aghast.
&ldquo;Really, if this goes on,&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;I
shall have to drop a pin! Oh, it&rsquo;s <i>my</i> fault, is
it?&rdquo; (In answer to an appealing look from Mein
Herr.) &ldquo;I was forgetting my duty. Chapter
Two! Wild-Creatures!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We found the Moving-Pictures a <i>little</i>
monotonous,&rdquo; said Mein Herr. &ldquo;People
didn&rsquo;t care to talk Art through a whole dinner;
so we tried Wild-Creatures. Among the flowers,
which we laid (just as <i>you</i> do) about the table,
were to be seen, here a mouse, there a beetle;
here a spider,&rdquo; (Lady Muriel shuddered) &ldquo;there
a wasp; here a toad, there a snake;&rdquo; (&ldquo;Father!&rdquo;
<span class="pb" id="Page_145">145</span>
said Lady Muriel, plaintively. &ldquo;Did you hear
<i>that</i>?&rdquo;) &ldquo;so we had plenty to talk about!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And when you got stung&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; the old lady
began.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They were all chained-up, dear Madam!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the old lady gave a satisfied nod.</p>
<p>There was no silence to follow, <i>this</i> time.
&ldquo;Third Chapter!&rdquo; Lady Muriel proclaimed at
once, &ldquo;Moving-Guests!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even the Wild-Creatures proved monotonous,&rdquo;
the orator proceeded. &ldquo;So we left the
guests to choose their own subjects; and, to
avoid monotony, we changed <i>them</i>. We made
the table of <i>two</i> rings; and the inner ring
moved slowly round, all the time, along with
the floor in the middle and the inner row of
guests. Thus <i>every</i> inner guest was brought
face-to-face with <i>every</i> outer guest. It was a
little confusing, sometimes, to have to <i>begin</i> a
story to one friend and <i>finish</i> it to another;
but <i>every</i> plan has its faults, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fourth Chapter!&rdquo; Lady Muriel hastened
to announce. &ldquo;The Revolving-Humorist!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For a <i>small</i> party we found it an excellent
plan to have a round table, with a hole cut in
<span class="pb" id="Page_146">146</span>
the middle large enough to hold <i>one</i> guest.
Here we placed our <i>best</i> talker. He revolved
slowly, facing every other guest in turn: and
he told lively anecdotes the whole time!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t like it!&rdquo; murmured the pompous
man. &ldquo;It would make me giddy, revolving
like that! I should decline to&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; here it
appeared to dawn upon him that perhaps the
assumption he was making was not warranted
by the circumstances: he took a hasty gulp of
wine, and choked himself.</p>
<p>But Mein Herr had relapsed into reverie,
and made no further remark. Lady Muriel
gave the signal, and the ladies left the room.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">147</div>
<h2 id="c10">CHAPTER X.
<br /><span class="small">JABBERING AND JAM.</span></h2>
<p>When the last lady had disappeared, and
the Earl, taking his place at the head of the
table, had issued the military order &ldquo;Gentlemen!
Close up the ranks, if you please!&rdquo;,
and when, in obedience to his command, we
had gathered ourselves compactly round him,
the pompous man gave a deep sigh of relief,
filled his glass to the brim, pushed on the
wine, and began one of his favorite orations.
&ldquo;They are charming, no doubt! Charming,
but very frivolous. They drag us down, so
to speak, to a lower level. They&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">148</div>
<p>&ldquo;Do not all pronouns require antecedent
<i>nouns</i>?&rdquo; the Earl gently enquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pardon me,&rdquo; said the pompous man, with
lofty condescension. &ldquo;I had overlooked the
noun. The ladies. We regret their absence.
Yet we console ourselves. <i>Thought is free.</i>
With them, we are limited to <i>trivial</i> topics&mdash;Art,
Literature, Politics, and so forth. One
can bear to discuss <i>such</i> paltry matters with
a lady. But no man, in his senses&mdash;&rdquo; (he
looked sternly round the table, as if defying
contradiction) &ldquo;&mdash;ever yet discussed <i>WINE</i>
with a lady!&rdquo; He sipped his glass of port,
leaned back in his chair, and slowly raised it
up to his eye, so as to look through it at the
lamp. &ldquo;The vintage, my Lord?&rdquo; he enquired,
glancing at his host.</p>
<p>The Earl named the date.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I had supposed. But one likes to be
certain. The <i>tint</i> is, perhaps, slightly pale.
But the <i>body</i> is unquestionable. And as for
the <i>bouquet</i>&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ah, that magic Bouquet! How vividly
that single word recalled the scene! The
little beggar-boy turning his somersault in
<span class="pb" id="Page_149">149</span>
the road&mdash;the sweet little crippled maiden in
my arms&mdash;the mysterious evanescent nurse-maid&mdash;all
rushed tumultuously into my mind,
like the creatures of a dream: and through
this mental haze there still boomed on, like
the tolling of a bell, the solemn voice of the
great connoisseur of <i>WINE</i>!</p>
<p>Even <i>his</i> utterances had taken on themselves
a strange and dream-like form. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he
resumed&mdash;and <i>why</i> is it, I pause to ask, that,
in taking up the broken thread of a dialogue,
one <i>always</i> begins with this cheerless monosyllable?
After much anxious thought, I have
come to the conclusion that the object in view
is the same as that of the schoolboy, when the
sum he is working has got into a hopeless
muddle, and when in despair he takes the
sponge, washes it all out, and begins again.
Just in the same way the bewildered orator,
by the simple process of denying <i>everything</i>
that has been hitherto asserted, makes a clean
sweep of the whole discussion, and can &lsquo;start
fair&rsquo; with a fresh theory. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he resumed:
&ldquo;there&rsquo;s nothing like cherry-jam, after all.
That&rsquo;s what <i>I</i> say!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">150</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not for <i>all</i> qualities!&rdquo; an eager little man
shrilly interposed. &ldquo;For <i>richness</i> of general
tone I don&rsquo;t say that it <i>has</i> a rival. But for
<i>delicacy</i> of modulation&mdash;for what one may call
the &lsquo;<i>harmonics</i>&rsquo; of flavour&mdash;give <i>me</i> good
old <i>raspberry</i>-jam!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Allow me one word!&rdquo; The fat red-faced
man, quite hoarse with excitement, broke into
the dialogue. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s too important a question
to be settled by Amateurs! I can give you
the views of a <i>Professional</i>&mdash;perhaps the most
experienced jam-taster now living. Why, I&rsquo;ve
known him fix the age of strawberry-jam, to
a <i>day</i>&mdash;and we all know what a difficult jam
it is to give a date to&mdash;on a single tasting!
Well, I put to him the <i>very</i> question you are
discussing. His words were &lsquo;<i>cherry</i>-jam is
best, for mere <i>chiaroscuro</i> of flavour: <i>raspberry</i>-jam
lends itself best to those resolved discords
that linger so lovingly on the tongue: but, for
rapturous <i>utterness</i> of saccharine perfection, it&rsquo;s
<i>apricot-jam first and the rest nowhere</i>!&rsquo; That
was well put, <i>wasn&rsquo;t</i> it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Consummately put!&rdquo; shrieked the eager
little man.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">151</div>
<p>&ldquo;I know your friend well,&rdquo; said the pompous
man. &ldquo;As a jam-taster, he has no rival! Yet
I scarcely think&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But here the discussion became general: and
his words were lost in a confused medley of
names, every guest sounding the praises of his
own favorite jam. At length, through the
din, our host&rsquo;s voice made itself heard. &ldquo;Let
us join the ladies!&rdquo; These words seemed to
recall me to waking life; and I felt sure that,
for the last few minutes, I had relapsed into
the &lsquo;eerie&rsquo; state.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A strange dream!&rdquo; I said to myself as we
trooped upstairs. &ldquo;Grown men discussing, as
seriously as if they were matters of life and
death, the hopelessly trivial details of mere
<i>delicacies</i>, that appeal to no higher human
function than the nerves of the tongue and
palate! What a humiliating spectacle such a
discussion would be in waking life!&rdquo;</p>
<p>When, on our way to the drawing-room, I
received from the housekeeper my little friends,
clad in the daintiest of evening costumes, and
looking, in the flush of expectant delight, more
radiantly beautiful than I had ever seen them
<span class="pb" id="Page_152">152</span>
before, I felt no shock of surprise, but accepted
the fact with the same unreasoning apathy with
which one meets the events of a dream, and
was merely conscious of a vague anxiety as to
how they would acquit themselves in so novel
a scene&mdash;forgetting that Court-life in Outland
was as good training as they could need for
Society in the more substantial world.</p>
<p>It would be best, I thought, to introduce
them as soon as possible to some good-natured
lady-guest, and I selected the young lady whose
piano-forte-playing had been so much talked of.
&ldquo;I am sure you like children,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;May
I introduce two little friends of mine? This is
Sylvie&mdash;and this is Bruno.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young lady kissed Sylvie very graciously.
She would have done the same for <i>Bruno</i>, but
he hastily drew back out of reach. &ldquo;Their
faces are new to me,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Where do
you come from, my dear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had not anticipated so inconvenient a
question; and, fearing that it might embarrass
Sylvie, I answered for her. &ldquo;They come from
some distance. They are only here just for
this one evening.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">153</div>
<p>&ldquo;How far have you come, dear?&rdquo; the young
lady persisted.</p>
<p>Sylvie looked puzzled. &ldquo;A mile or two, I
<i>think</i>,&rdquo; she said doubtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A mile or <i>three</i>,&rdquo; said Bruno.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shouldn&rsquo;t say &lsquo;a mile or <i>three</i>,&rsquo;&rdquo; Sylvie
corrected him.</p>
<p>The young lady nodded approval. &ldquo;Sylvie&rsquo;s
quite right. It isn&rsquo;t usual to say &lsquo;a mile or
<i>three</i>.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would be usual&mdash;if we said it often
enough,&rdquo; said Bruno.</p>
<p>It was the young lady&rsquo;s turn to look puzzled
now. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s very quick, for his age!&rdquo; she
murmured. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not more than seven, are
you, dear?&rdquo; she added aloud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not so many as <i>that</i>,&rdquo; said Bruno.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m <i>one</i>. Sylvie&rsquo;s <i>one</i>. Sylvie and me is
<i>two</i>. <i>Sylvie</i> taught me to count.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I wasn&rsquo;t <i>counting</i> you, you know!&rdquo;
the young lady laughingly replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hasn&rsquo;t oo <i>learnt</i> to count?&rdquo; said Bruno.</p>
<p>The young lady bit her lip. &ldquo;Dear! What
embarrassing questions he <i>does</i> ask!&rdquo; she said
in a half-audible &lsquo;aside.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">154</div>
<p>&ldquo;Bruno, you shouldn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; Sylvie said reprovingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shouldn&rsquo;t <i>what</i>?&rdquo; said Bruno.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shouldn&rsquo;t ask&mdash;that sort of questions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>What</i> sort of questions?&rdquo; Bruno mischievously
persisted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What <i>she</i> told you not,&rdquo; Sylvie replied,
with a shy glance at the young lady, and losing
all sense of grammar in her confusion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oo ca&rsquo;n&rsquo;t pronounce it!&rdquo; Bruno triumphantly
cried. And he turned to the young lady,
for sympathy in his victory. &ldquo;I <i>knewed</i> she
couldn&rsquo;t pronounce &lsquo;umbrella-sting&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young lady thought it best to return to
the arithmetical problem. &ldquo;When I asked if
you were <i>seven</i>, you know, I didn&rsquo;t mean
&lsquo;how many <i>children</i>?&rsquo; I meant &lsquo;how many
<i>years</i>&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only got <i>two</i> ears,&rdquo; said Bruno. &ldquo;Nobody&rsquo;s
got <i>seven</i> ears.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you belong to this little girl?&rdquo; the
young lady continued, skilfully evading the
anatomical problem.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I doosn&rsquo;t belong to <i>her</i>!&rdquo; said Bruno.
&ldquo;Sylvie belongs to <i>me</i>!&rdquo; And he clasped
<span class="pb" id="Page_155">155</span>
his arms round her as he added &ldquo;She are my
very mine!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And, do you know,&rdquo; said the young lady,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve a little sister at home, exactly like <i>your</i>
sister? I&rsquo;m sure they&rsquo;d love each other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;d be very extremely useful to each
other,&rdquo; Bruno said, thoughtfully. &ldquo;And they
wouldn&rsquo;t want no looking-glasses to brush their
hair wiz.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not, my child?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, each one would do for the other one&rsquo;s
looking-glass, a-course!&rdquo; cried Bruno.</p>
<p>But here Lady Muriel, who had been standing
by, listening to this bewildering dialogue,
interrupted it to ask if the young lady would
favour us with some music; and the children
followed their new friend to the piano.</p>
<p>Arthur came and sat down by me. &ldquo;If
rumour speaks truly,&rdquo; he whispered, &ldquo;we are to
have a real treat!&rdquo; And then, amid a breathless
silence, the performance began.</p>
<p>She was one of those players whom Society
talks of as &lsquo;brilliant,&rsquo; and she dashed into the
loveliest of Haydn&rsquo;s Symphonies in a style that
was clearly the outcome of years of patient
<span class="pb" id="Page_156">156</span>
study under the best masters. At first it
seemed to be the perfection of piano-forte-playing;
but in a few minutes I began to ask
myself, wearily, &ldquo;<i>What</i> is it that is wanting?
<i>Why</i> does one get no pleasure from it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then I set myself to listen intently to
every note; and the mystery explained itself.
There <i>was</i> an almost-perfect mechanical <i>correctness</i>&mdash;and
there was nothing else! False
notes, of course, did not occur: she knew the
piece too well for <i>that</i>; but there was just
enough irregularity of <i>time</i> to betray that the
player had no real &lsquo;ear&rsquo; for music&mdash;just
enough inarticulateness in the more elaborate
passages to show that she did not think her
audience worth taking real pains for&mdash;just
enough mechanical monotony of accent to take
all <i>soul</i> out of the heavenly modulations she
was profaning&mdash;in short, it was simply irritating;
and, when she had rattled off the finale
and had struck the final chord as if, the instrument
being now done with, it didn&rsquo;t matter
how many wires she broke, I could not even
<i>affect</i> to join in the stereotyped &ldquo;Oh, <i>thank</i>
you!&rdquo; which was chorused around me.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">157</div>
<p>Lady Muriel joined us for a moment.
&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it <i>beautiful</i>?&rdquo; she whispered, to Arthur,
with a mischievous smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it isn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; said Arthur. But the gentle
sweetness of his face quite neutralised the
apparent rudeness of the reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Such execution, you know!&rdquo; she persisted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what she <i>deserves</i>,&rdquo; Arthur doggedly
replied: &ldquo;but people are so prejudiced against
capital&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now you&rsquo;re beginning to talk nonsense!&rdquo;
Lady Muriel cried. &ldquo;But you <i>do</i> like Music,
don&rsquo;t you? You said so just now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do I like <i>Music</i>?&rdquo; the Doctor repeated
softly to himself. &ldquo;My dear Lady Muriel,
there is Music and Music. Your question is
painfully vague. You might as well ask &lsquo;Do
you like <i>People</i>?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lady Muriel bit her lip, frowned, and
stamped with one tiny foot. As a dramatic
representation of ill-temper, it was distinctly
<i>not</i> a success. However, it took in <i>one</i> of her
audience, and Bruno hastened to interpose, as
peacemaker in a rising quarrel, with the remark
&ldquo;<i>I</i> likes Peoples!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">158</div>
<p>Arthur laid a loving hand on the little curly
head. &ldquo;What? <i>All</i> Peoples?&rdquo; he enquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not <i>all</i> Peoples,&rdquo; Bruno explained. &ldquo;Only
but Sylvie&mdash;and Lady Muriel&mdash;and him&mdash;&rdquo;
(pointing to the Earl) &ldquo;and oo&mdash;and oo!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shouldn&rsquo;t point at people,&rdquo; said Sylvie.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very rude.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In Bruno&rsquo;s World,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;there are only
<i>four</i> People&mdash;worth mentioning!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In Bruno&rsquo;s World!&rdquo; Lady Muriel repeated
thoughtfully. &ldquo;A bright and flowery world.
Where the grass is always green, where the
breezes always blow softly, and the rain-clouds
never gather; where there are no wild beasts,
and no deserts&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There <i>must</i> be deserts,&rdquo; Arthur decisively
remarked. &ldquo;At least if it was <i>my</i> ideal world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what possible use is there in a <i>desert</i>?&rdquo;
said Lady Muriel. &ldquo;<i>Surely</i> you would have
no wilderness in your ideal world?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Arthur smiled. &ldquo;But indeed I <i>would</i>!&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;A wilderness would be more necessary
than a railway; and <i>far</i> more conducive to
general happiness than church-bells!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what would you use it for?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">159</div>
<p>&ldquo;<i>To practise music in</i>,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;All the
young ladies, that have no ear for music, but
insist on learning it, should be conveyed,
every morning, two or three miles into the
wilderness. There each would find a comfortable
room provided for her, and also a cheap
second-hand piano-forte, on which she might
play for hours, without adding one needless
pang to the sum of human misery!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lady Muriel glanced round in alarm, lest
these barbarous sentiments should be overheard.
But the fair musician was at a safe
distance. &ldquo;At any rate you must allow that
she&rsquo;s a sweet girl?&rdquo; she resumed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, certainly. As sweet as <i>eau sucr&eacute;e</i>, if
you choose&mdash;and nearly as interesting!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are incorrigible!&rdquo; said Lady Muriel,
and turned to me. &ldquo;I hope you found Mrs.
Mills an interesting companion?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, <i>that&rsquo;s</i> her name, is it?&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I
fancied there was <i>more</i> of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So there is: and it will be &lsquo;at your proper
peril&rsquo; (whatever that may mean) if you ever
presume to address her as &lsquo;Mrs. Mills.&rsquo; She
is &lsquo;Mrs. Ernest&mdash;Atkinson&mdash;Mills&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">160</div>
<p>&ldquo;She is one of those would-be grandees,&rdquo;
said Arthur, &ldquo;who think that, by tacking on to
their surname all their spare Christian-names,
with hyphens between, they can give it an
aristocratic flavour. As if it wasn&rsquo;t trouble
enough to remember <i>one</i> surname!&rdquo;</p>
<p>By this time the room was getting crowded,
as the guests, invited for the evening-party,
were beginning to arrive, and Lady Muriel
had to devote herself to the task of welcoming
them, which she did with the sweetest grace
imaginable. Sylvie and Bruno stood by her,
deeply interested in the process.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope you like my friends?&rdquo; she said to
them. &ldquo;Specially my dear old friend, Mein
Herr (What&rsquo;s become of him, I wonder?
Oh, there he is!), that old gentleman in
spectacles, with a long beard?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a grand old gentleman!&rdquo; Sylvie said,
gazing admiringly at &lsquo;Mein Herr,&rsquo; who had
settled down in a corner, from which his mild
eyes beamed on us through a gigantic pair of
spectacles. &ldquo;And what a lovely beard!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does he call his-self?&rdquo; Bruno
whispered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">161</div>
<p>&ldquo;He calls himself &lsquo;Mein Herr,&rsquo;&rdquo; Sylvie
whispered in reply.</p>
<p>Bruno shook his head impatiently. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
what he calls his <i>hair</i>, not his <i>self</i>, oo silly!&rdquo;
He appealed to me. &ldquo;What doos he call his
<i>self</i>, Mister Sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the only name <i>I</i> know of,&rdquo; I said.
&ldquo;But he looks very lonely. Don&rsquo;t you pity his
grey hairs?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I pities his <i>self</i>,&rdquo; said Bruno, still harping
on the misnomer; &ldquo;but I doosn&rsquo;t pity his
<i>hair</i>, one bit. His <i>hair</i> ca&rsquo;n&rsquo;t feel!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We met him this afternoon,&rdquo; said Sylvie.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;d been to see Nero, and we&rsquo;d had <i>such</i>
fun with him, making him invisible again!
And we saw that nice old gentleman as we
came back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, let&rsquo;s go and talk to him, and cheer
him up a little,&rdquo; I said: &ldquo;and perhaps we
shall find out what he calls himself.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">162</div>
<h2 id="c11">CHAPTER XI.
<br /><span class="small">THE MAN IN THE MOON.</span></h2>
<p>The children came willingly. With one of
them on each side of me, I approached the
corner occupied by &lsquo;Mein Herr.&rsquo; &ldquo;You
don&rsquo;t object to <i>children</i>, I hope?&rdquo; I began.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Crabbed age and youth cannot live together!</i>&rdquo;
the old man cheerfully replied, with
a most genial smile. &ldquo;Now take a good look
at me, my children! You would guess me to
be an <i>old</i> man, wouldn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>At first sight, though his face had reminded
me so mysteriously of &ldquo;the Professor,&rdquo; he
had seemed to be decidedly a <i>younger</i> man:
<span class="pb" id="Page_163">163</span>
but, when I came to look into the wonderful
depth of those large dreamy eyes, I felt,
with a strange sense of awe, that he was incalculably
<i>older</i>: he seemed to gaze at us
out of some by-gone age, centuries away.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig12">
<img src="images/i163.jpg" alt="MEIN HERR&rsquo;S FAIRY-FRIENDS" width="500" height="431" />
<p class="center small">MEIN HERR&rsquo;S FAIRY-FRIENDS</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know if oo&rsquo;re an <i>old</i> man,&rdquo; Bruno
answered, as the children, won over by the
gentle voice, crept a little closer to him. &ldquo;I
thinks oo&rsquo;re <i>eighty-three</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">164</div>
<p>&ldquo;He is very exact!&rdquo; said Mein Herr.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is he anything like right?&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are reasons,&rdquo; Mein Herr gently
replied, &ldquo;reasons which I am not at liberty
to explain, for not mentioning <i>definitely</i> any
Persons, Places, or Dates. One remark only
I will permit myself to make&mdash;that the
period of life, between the ages of a hundred-and-sixty-five
and a hundred-and-seventy-five,
is a specially <i>safe</i> one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you make that out?&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thus. You would consider swimming to
be a very safe amusement, if you scarcely
ever heard of any one dying of it. Am I
not right in thinking that you never heard of
any one dying between those two ages?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see what you mean,&rdquo; I said: &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m
afraid you ca&rsquo;n&rsquo;t prove <i>swimming</i> to be safe,
on the same principle. It is no uncommon
thing to hear of some one being <i>drowned</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In <i>my</i> country,&rdquo; said Mein Herr, &ldquo;no
one is <i>ever</i> drowned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is there no water deep enough?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Plenty! But we ca&rsquo;n&rsquo;t <i>sink</i>. We are all
<i>lighter than water</i>. Let me explain,&rdquo; he added,
<span class="pb" id="Page_165">165</span>
seeing my look of surprise. &ldquo;Suppose you
desire a race of <i>pigeons</i> of a particular shape
or colour, do you not select, from year to
year, those that are nearest to the shape or
colour you want, and keep those, and part
with the others?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We do,&rdquo; I replied. &ldquo;We call it &lsquo;Artificial
Selection.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly so,&rdquo; said Mein Herr. &ldquo;Well, <i>we</i>
have practised that for some centuries&mdash;constantly
selecting the <i>lightest</i> people: so that,
now, <i>everybody</i> is lighter than water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you never can be drowned at <i>sea</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never! It is only on the <i>land</i>&mdash;for instance,
when attending a play in a theatre&mdash;that
we are in such a danger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can that happen at a <i>theatre</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our theatres are all <i>underground</i>. Large
tanks of water are placed above. If a fire
breaks out, the taps are turned, and in one
minute the theatre is flooded, up to the very
roof! Thus the fire is extinguished.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>And</i> the audience, I presume?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is a minor matter,&rdquo; Mein Herr carelessly
replied. &ldquo;But they have the comfort of
<span class="pb" id="Page_166">166</span>
knowing that, whether drowned or not, they
are all <i>lighter than water</i>. We have not yet
reached the standard of making people lighter
than <i>air</i>: but we are <i>aiming</i> at it; and, in
another thousand years or so&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What doos oo do wiz the peoples that&rsquo;s
too heavy?&rdquo; Bruno solemnly enquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have applied the same process,&rdquo; Mein
Herr continued, not noticing Bruno&rsquo;s question,
&ldquo;to many other purposes. We have
gone on selecting <i>walking-sticks</i>&mdash;always
keeping those that walked <i>best</i>&mdash;till we have
obtained some, that can walk by themselves!
We have gone on selecting <i>cotton-wool</i>, till we
have got some lighter than air! You&rsquo;ve no
idea what a useful material it is! We call
it &lsquo;Imponderal.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you use it for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, chiefly for <i>packing</i> articles, to go
by Parcel-Post. It makes them weigh <i>less
than nothing</i>, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how do the Post-Office people know
what you have to pay?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the beauty of the new system!&rdquo;
Mein Herr cried exultingly. &ldquo;They pay <i>us</i>:
<span class="pb" id="Page_167">167</span>
we don&rsquo;t pay <i>them</i>! I&rsquo;ve often got as much
as five shillings for sending a parcel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But doesn&rsquo;t your Government object?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, they <i>do</i> object, a little. They say
it comes so expensive, in the long run. But
the thing&rsquo;s as clear as daylight, by their own
rules. If I send a parcel, that weighs a
pound <i>more</i> than nothing, I <i>pay</i> three-pence:
so, of course, if it weighs a pound <i>less</i> than
nothing, I ought to <i>receive</i> three-pence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is <i>indeed</i> a useful article!&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet even &lsquo;Imponderal&rsquo; has its disadvantages,&rdquo;
he resumed. &ldquo;I bought some, a few
days ago, and put it into my <i>hat</i>, to carry it
home, and the hat simply floated away!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Had oo some of that funny stuff in oor hat
<i>today</i>?&rdquo; Bruno enquired. &ldquo;Sylvie and me
saw oo in the road, and oor hat were ever so
high up! Weren&rsquo;t it, Sylvie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, that was quite another thing.&rdquo; said
Mein Herr. &ldquo;There was a drop or two of
rain falling: so I put my hat on the top of
my stick&mdash;as an umbrella, you know. As I
came along the road,&rdquo; he continued, turning
to me, &ldquo;I was overtaken by&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">168</div>
<p>&ldquo;&mdash;&mdash;a shower of rain?&rdquo; said Bruno.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it <i>looked</i> more like the tail of a dog,&rdquo;
Mein Herr replied. &ldquo;It was the most curious
thing! Something rubbed affectionately against
my knee. And I looked down. And I could
see <i>nothing</i>! Only, about a yard off, there was
a dog&rsquo;s tail, wagging, all by itself!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, <i>Sylvie</i>!&rdquo; Bruno murmured reproachfully.
&ldquo;Oo didn&rsquo;t finish making him visible!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m <i>so</i> sorry!&rdquo; Sylvie said, looking very
penitent. &ldquo;I meant to rub it along his back,
but we were in such a hurry. We&rsquo;ll go and
finish him tomorrow. Poor thing! Perhaps
he&rsquo;ll get no supper tonight!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Course</i> he won&rsquo;t!&rdquo; said Bruno. &ldquo;Nobody
never gives bones to a dog&rsquo;s tail!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mein Herr looked from one to the other in
blank astonishment. &ldquo;I do not understand
you,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I had lost my way, and I was
consulting a pocket-map, and somehow I had
dropped one of my gloves, and this invisible
<i>Something</i>, that had rubbed against my knee,
actually brought it back to me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Course he did!&rdquo; said Bruno. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
<i>welly</i> fond of fetching things.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">169</div>
<p>Mein Herr looked so thoroughly bewildered
that I thought it best to change the subject.
&ldquo;What a useful thing a pocket-map is!&rdquo; I
remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s another thing we&rsquo;ve learned from
<i>your</i> Nation,&rdquo; said Mein Herr, &ldquo;map-making.
But we&rsquo;ve carried it much further than <i>you</i>.
What do you consider the <i>largest</i> map that
would be really useful?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About six inches to the mile.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only <i>six inches</i>!&rdquo; exclaimed Mein Herr.
&ldquo;We very soon got to six <i>yards</i> to the mile.
Then we tried a <i>hundred</i> yards to the mile.
And then came the grandest idea of all! We
actually made a map of the country, on the
scale of <i>a mile to the mile</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you used it much?&rdquo; I enquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It has never been spread out, yet,&rdquo; said
Mein Herr: &ldquo;the farmers objected: they said
it would cover the whole country, and shut out
the sunlight! So we now use the country itself,
as its own map, and I assure you it does
nearly as well. Now let me ask you <i>another</i>
question. What is the smallest <i>world</i> you
would care to inhabit?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">170</div>
<p>&ldquo;<i>I</i> know!&rdquo; cried Bruno, who was listening
intently. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like a little teeny-tiny world,
just big enough for Sylvie and me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you would have to stand on opposite
sides of it,&rdquo; said Mein Herr. &ldquo;And so you
would never see your sister <i>at all</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;d have no <i>lessons</i>,&rdquo; said Bruno.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean to say you&rsquo;ve been trying
experiments in <i>that</i> direction!&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, not <i>experiments</i> exactly. We do not
profess to <i>construct</i> planets. But a scientific
friend of mine, who has made several balloon-voyages,
assures me he has visited a planet so
small that he could walk right round it in
twenty minutes! There had been a great
battle, just before his visit, which had ended
rather oddly: the vanquished army ran away
at full speed, and in a very few minutes found
themselves face-to-face with the victorious
army, who were marching home again, and
who were so frightened at finding themselves
between <i>two</i> armies, that they surrendered at
once! Of course that lost them the battle,
though, as a matter of fact, they had killed <i>all</i>
the soldiers on the other side.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">171</div>
<p>&ldquo;Killed soldiers <i>ca&rsquo;n&rsquo;t</i> run away,&rdquo; Bruno
thoughtfully remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Killed&rsquo; is a technical word,&rdquo; replied Mein
Herr. &ldquo;In the little planet I speak of, the
bullets were made of soft black stuff, which
marked everything it touched. So, after a
battle, all you had to do was to count how
many soldiers on each side were &lsquo;killed&rsquo;&mdash;that
means &lsquo;marked on the <i>back</i>,&rsquo; for marks in
<i>front</i> didn&rsquo;t count.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you couldn&rsquo;t &lsquo;kill&rsquo; any, unless they
ran away?&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My scientific friend found out a better
plan than <i>that</i>. He pointed out that, if only
the bullets were sent <i>the other way round the
world</i>, they would hit the enemy in the <i>back</i>.
After that, the <i>worst</i> marksmen were considered
the <i>best</i> soldiers; and <i>the very worst of
all</i> always got First Prize.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how did you decide which was <i>the
very worst of all</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Easily. The <i>best</i> possible shooting is, you
know, to hit what is exactly in <i>front</i> of you:
so of course the <i>worst</i> possible is to hit what
is exactly <i>behind</i> you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">172</div>
<p>&ldquo;They were strange people in that little
planet!&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They were indeed! Perhaps their method
of <i>government</i> was the strangest of all. In
<i>this</i> planet, I am told, a Nation consists of a
number of Subjects, and one King: but, in
the little planet I speak of, it consisted of a
number of <i>Kings</i>, and one <i>Subject</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You say you are &lsquo;told&rsquo; what happens in
<i>this</i> planet,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;May I venture to guess
that you yourself are a visitor from some <i>other</i>
planet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bruno clapped his hands in his excitement.
&ldquo;Is oo the Man-in-the-Moon?&rdquo; he cried.</p>
<p>Mein Herr looked uneasy. &ldquo;I am <i>not</i> in
the Moon, my child,&rdquo; he said evasively. &ldquo;To
return to what I was saying. I think <i>that</i>
method of government ought to answer <i>well</i>.
You see, the Kings would be sure to make
Laws contradicting each other: so the Subject
could never be punished, because, <i>whatever</i> he
did, he&rsquo;d be obeying <i>some</i> Law.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And, whatever he did, he&rsquo;d be <i>dis</i>obeying
<i>some</i> Law!&rdquo; cried Bruno. &ldquo;So he&rsquo;d <i>always</i>
be punished!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">173</div>
<p>Lady Muriel was passing at the moment, and
caught the last word. &ldquo;Nobody&rsquo;s going to
be punished <i>here</i>!&rdquo; she said, taking Bruno
in her arms. &ldquo;This is Liberty-Hall! Would
you lend me the children for a minute?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The children desert us, you see,&rdquo; I said to
Mein Herr, as she carried them off: &ldquo;so we
old folk must keep each other company!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man sighed. &ldquo;Ah, well! We&rsquo;re old
folk <i>now</i>; and yet I was a child myself, once&mdash;at
least I fancy so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It <i>did</i> seem a rather unlikely fancy, I could
not help owning to myself&mdash;looking at the
shaggy white hair, and the long beard&mdash;that
he could <i>ever</i> have been a child. &ldquo;You are
fond of young people?&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Young <i>men</i>,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;Not of <i>children</i>
exactly. I used to teach young men&mdash;many
a year ago&mdash;in my dear old University!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t quite catch its <i>name</i>?&rdquo; I hinted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did not name it,&rdquo; the old man replied
mildly. &ldquo;Nor would you know the name if I
did. Strange tales I could tell you of all the
changes I have witnessed there! But it would
weary you, I fear.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_174">174</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, <i>indeed</i>!&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Pray go on. What
kind of changes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the old man seemed to be more in a
humour for questions than for answers. &ldquo;Tell
me,&rdquo; he said, laying his hand impressively on
my arm, &ldquo;tell me something. For I am a
stranger in your land, and I know little of <i>your</i>
modes of education: yet something tells me
<i>we</i> are further on than <i>you</i> in the eternal cycle
of change&mdash;and that many a theory <i>we</i> have
tried and found to fail, <i>you</i> also will try, with
a wilder enthusiasm: you also will find to fail,
with a bitterer despair!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was strange to see how, as he talked, and
his words flowed more and more freely, with a
certain rhythmic eloquence, his features seemed
to glow with an inner light, and the whole man
seemed to be transformed, as if he had grown
fifty years younger in a moment of time.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_175">175</div>
<h2 id="c12">CHAPTER XII.
<br /><span class="small">FAIRY-MUSIC.</span></h2>
<p>The silence that ensued was broken by the
voice of the musical young lady, who had seated
herself near us, and was conversing with one of
the newly-arrived guests. &ldquo;Well!&rdquo; she said in
a tone of scornful surprise. &ldquo;We <i>are</i> to have
something new in the way of music, it appears!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I looked round for an explanation, and was
nearly as much astonished as the speaker herself:
it was <i>Sylvie</i> whom Lady Muriel was
leading to the piano!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do try it, my darling!&rdquo; she was saying.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you can play very nicely!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">176</div>
<p>Sylvie looked round at me, with tears in her
eyes. I tried to give her an encouraging
smile, but it was evidently a great strain on the
nerves of a child so wholly unused to be made
an exhibition of, and she was frightened and
unhappy. Yet here came out the perfect sweetness
of her disposition: I could see that she
was resolved to forget herself, and do her best
to give pleasure to Lady Muriel and her friends.
She seated herself at the instrument, and began
instantly. Time and expression, so far as one
could judge, were perfect: but her touch was
one of such extraordinary lightness that it was
at first scarcely possible, through the hum of
conversation which still continued, to catch a
note of what she was playing.</p>
<p>But in a minute the hum had died away into
absolute silence, and we all sat, entranced and
breathless, to listen to such heavenly music as
none then present could ever forget.</p>
<p>Hardly touching the notes at first, she played
a sort of introduction in a minor key&mdash;like an
embodied twilight; one felt as though the lights
were growing dim, and a mist were creeping
through the room. Then there flashed through
<span class="pb" id="Page_177">177</span>
the gathering gloom the first few notes of a
melody so lovely, so delicate, that one held
one&rsquo;s breath, fearful to lose a single note of it.
Ever and again the music dropped into the
pathetic minor key with which it had begun,
and, each time that the melody forced its way,
so to speak, through the enshrouding gloom
into the light of day, it was more entrancing,
more magically sweet. Under the airy touch
of the child, the instrument actually seemed
to <i>warble</i>, like a bird. &ldquo;<i>Rise up, my love, my
fair one</i>,&rdquo; it seemed to sing, &ldquo;<i>and come away!
For lo, the winter is past, the rain is over and
gone; the flowers appear on the earth; the time
of the singing of birds is come!</i>&rdquo; One could
fancy one heard the tinkle of the last few
drops, shaken from the trees by a passing
gust&mdash;that one saw the first glittering rays
of the sun, breaking through the clouds.</p>
<p>The Count hurried across the room in great
excitement. &ldquo;I <i>cannot</i> remember myself,&rdquo; he
exclaimed, &ldquo;of the name of this so charming
an air! It is of an opera, most surely. Yet
not even will the <i>opera</i> remind his name to
me! What you call him, dear child?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_178">178</div>
<div class="img" id="fig13">
<img src="images/i178.jpg" alt="&lsquo;HOW CALL YOU THE OPERA?&rsquo;" width="500" height="440" />
<p class="center small">&lsquo;HOW CALL YOU THE OPERA?&rsquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Sylvie looked round at him with a rapt expression
of face. She had ceased playing, but
her fingers still wandered fitfully over the keys.
All fear and shyness had quite passed away
now, and nothing remained but the pure joy
of the music that had thrilled our hearts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The title of it!&rdquo; the Count repeated impatiently.
&ldquo;How call you the opera?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what an opera <i>is</i>,&rdquo; Sylvie
half-whispered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">179</div>
<p>&ldquo;How, then, call you the <i>air</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know any name for it,&rdquo; Sylvie
replied, as she rose from the instrument.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But this is marvellous!&rdquo; exclaimed the
Count, following the child, and addressing
himself to me, as if I were the proprietor of
this musical prodigy, and so <i>must</i> know the
origin of her music. &ldquo;You have heard her
play this, sooner&mdash;I would say &lsquo;before this
occasion&rsquo;? How call you the air?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I shook my head; but was saved from more
questions by Lady Muriel, who came up to
petition the Count for a song.</p>
<p>The Count spread out his hands apologetically,
and ducked his head. &ldquo;But, Milady, I
have already respected&mdash;I would say prospected&mdash;all
your songs; and there shall be
none fitted to my voice! They are not for
basso voices!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wo&rsquo;n&rsquo;t you look at them again?&rdquo; Lady
Muriel implored.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s help him!&rdquo; Bruno whispered to
Sylvie. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get him&mdash;<i>you</i> know!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sylvie nodded. &ldquo;Shall <i>we</i> look for a song
for you?&rdquo; she said sweetly to the Count.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_180">180</div>
<p>&ldquo;Mais <i>oui</i>!&rdquo; the little man exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course we may!&rdquo; said Bruno, while,
each taking a hand of the delighted Count,
they led him to the music-stand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is still hope!&rdquo; said Lady Muriel
over her shoulder, as she followed them.</p>
<p>I turned to &lsquo;Mein Herr,&rsquo; hoping to resume
our interrupted conversation. &ldquo;You were remarking&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
I began: but at this moment
Sylvie came to call Bruno, who had returned
to my side, looking unusually serious. &ldquo;<i>Do</i>
come, Bruno!&rdquo; she entreated. &ldquo;You know
we&rsquo;ve nearly found it!&rdquo; Then, in a whisper,
&ldquo;The locket&rsquo;s in my <i>hand</i>, now. I couldn&rsquo;t
get it out while they were looking!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Bruno drew back. &ldquo;The man called
me names,&rdquo; he said with dignity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What names?&rdquo; I enquired with some
curiosity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I asked him,&rdquo; said Bruno, &ldquo;which sort of
song he liked. And he said &lsquo;<i>A</i> song of <i>a</i>
man, not of <i>a</i> lady.&rsquo; And I said &lsquo;Shall Sylvie
and me find you the song of Mister Tottles?&rsquo;
And he said &lsquo;Wait, eel!&rsquo; And I&rsquo;m
<i>not</i> an eel, oo know!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">181</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m <i>sure</i> he didn&rsquo;t mean it!&rdquo; Sylvie said
earnestly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s something French&mdash;you
know he ca&rsquo;n&rsquo;t talk English so well as&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bruno relented visibly. &ldquo;Course he knows
no better, if he&rsquo;s Flench! Flenchmen <i>never</i>
can speak English so goodly as <i>us</i>!&rdquo; And
Sylvie led him away, a willing captive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nice children!&rdquo; said the old man, taking
off his spectacles and rubbing them carefully.
Then he put them on again, and watched with
an approving smile, while the children tossed
over the heap of music, and we just caught
Sylvie&rsquo;s reproving words, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re <i>not</i> making
hay, Bruno!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This has been a long interruption to our
conversation,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Pray let us go on!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Willingly!&rdquo; replied the gentle old man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was much interested in what you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
He paused a moment, and passed his hand
uneasily across his brow. &ldquo;One forgets,&rdquo; he
murmured. &ldquo;What was I saying? Oh! Something
you were to tell me. Yes. Which of
your teachers do you value the most highly,
those whose words are easily understood, or
those who puzzle you at every turn?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_182">182</div>
<p>I felt obliged to admit that we generally
admired most the teachers we couldn&rsquo;t quite
understand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just so,&rdquo; said Mein Herr. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the
way it begins. Well, <i>we</i> were at that stage
some eighty years ago&mdash;or was it ninety? Our
favourite teacher got more obscure every year;
and every year we admired him more&mdash;just
as <i>your</i> Art-fanciers call <i>mist</i> the fairest feature
in a landscape, and admire a view with frantic
delight when they can see nothing! Now I&rsquo;ll
tell you how it ended. It was Moral Philosophy
that our idol lectured on. Well, his pupils
couldn&rsquo;t make head or tail of it, but they got
it all by heart; and, when Examination-time
came, they wrote it down; and the Examiners
said &lsquo;Beautiful! What depth!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what good was it to the young men
<i>afterwards</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, don&rsquo;t you see?&rdquo; replied Mein Herr.
&ldquo;<i>They</i> became teachers in their turn, and <i>they</i>
said all these things over again; and <i>their</i>
pupils wrote it all down; and the Examiners
accepted it; and nobody had the ghost of an
idea what it all meant!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_183">183</div>
<p>&ldquo;And how did it end?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It ended this way. We woke up one fine
day, and found there was no one in the place
that knew <i>anything</i> about Moral Philosophy.
So we abolished it, teachers, classes, examiners,
and all. And if any one wanted to learn anything
about it, he had to make it out for
himself; and after another twenty years or so
there were several men that really knew something
about it! Now tell me another thing.
How long do you teach a youth before you
examine him, in your Universities?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I told him, three or four years.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just so, just what <i>we</i> did!&rdquo; he exclaimed.
&ldquo;We taught &rsquo;em a bit, and, just as they were
beginning to take it in, we took it all out again!
We pumped our wells dry before they were a
quarter full&mdash;we stripped our orchards while
the apples were still in blossom&mdash;we applied
the severe logic of arithmetic to our chickens,
while peacefully slumbering in their shells!
Doubtless it&rsquo;s the early bird that picks up the
worm&mdash;but if the bird gets up so outrageously
early that the worm is still deep underground,
what <i>then</i> is its chance of a breakfast?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_184">184</div>
<p>Not much, I admitted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now see how that works!&rdquo; he went on
eagerly. &ldquo;If you want to pump your wells
so soon&mdash;and I suppose you tell me that is
what you <i>must</i> do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;In an over-crowded
country like this, nothing but Competitive
Examinations&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mein Herr threw up his hands wildly.
&ldquo;What, <i>again</i>?&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;I thought it was
dead, fifty years ago! Oh this Upas tree of
Competitive Examinations! Beneath whose
deadly shade all the original genius, all the
exhaustive research, all the untiring life-long
diligence by which our fore-fathers have so
advanced human knowledge, must slowly but
surely wither away, and give place to a system
of Cookery, in which the human mind is
a sausage, and all we ask is, how much indigestible
stuff can be crammed into it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Always, after these bursts of eloquence, he
seemed to forget himself for a moment, and
only to hold on to the thread of thought by
some single word. &ldquo;Yes, <i>crammed</i>,&rdquo; he repeated.
&ldquo;We went through all that stage of
<span class="pb" id="Page_185">185</span>
the disease&mdash;had it bad, I warrant you! Of
course, as the Examination was all in all, we
tried to put in just what was wanted&mdash;and the
<i>great</i> thing to aim at was, that the Candidate
should know absolutely <i>nothing</i> beyond the
needs of the Examination! I don&rsquo;t say it was
ever <i>quite</i> achieved: but one of my own pupils
(pardon an old man&rsquo;s egotism) came very near
it. After the Examination, he mentioned to
me the few facts which he knew but had <i>not</i>
been able to bring in, and I can assure you
they were trivial, Sir, absolutely trivial!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I feebly expressed my surprise and delight.</p>
<p>The old man bowed, with a gratified smile,
and proceeded. &ldquo;At that time, no one had
hit on the much more rational plan of watching
for the individual scintillations of genius,
and rewarding them as they occurred. As it
was, we made our unfortunate pupil into a
Leyden-jar, charged him up to the eyelids&mdash;then
applied the knob of a Competitive Examination,
and drew off one magnificent spark,
which very often cracked the jar! What
mattered <i>that</i>? We labeled it &lsquo;First Class
Spark,&rsquo; and put it away on the shelf.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_186">186</div>
<p>&ldquo;But the more rational system&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo; I
suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, yes! <i>that</i> came next. Instead of
giving the whole reward of learning in one
lump, we used to pay for every good answer as
it occurred. How well I remember lecturing
in those days, with a heap of small coins at my
elbow! It was &lsquo;A <i>very</i> good answer, Mr.
Jones!&rsquo; (that meant a shilling, mostly). &lsquo;Bravo,
Mr. Robinson!&rsquo; (that meant half-a-crown).
Now I&rsquo;ll tell you how <i>that</i> worked. Not one
single fact would any of them take in, without
a fee! And when a clever boy came up from
school, he got paid more for learning than we
got paid for teaching him! Then came the
wildest craze of all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, <i>another</i> craze?&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the last one,&rdquo; said the old man. &ldquo;I
must have tired you out with my long story.
Each College wanted to get the clever boys:
so we adopted a system which we had heard
was very popular in England: the Colleges
competed against each other, and the boys
let themselves out to the highest bidder!
What geese we were! Why, they were bound
<span class="pb" id="Page_187">187</span>
to come to the University <i>somehow</i>. We
needn&rsquo;t have paid &rsquo;em! And all our money
went in getting clever boys to come to one
College rather than another! The competition
was so keen, that at last mere money-payments
were not enough. Any College, that wished
to secure some specially clever young man,
had to waylay him at the Station, and hunt
him through the streets. The first who
touched him was allowed to have him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That hunting-down of the scholars, as they
arrived, must have been a curious business,&rdquo;
I said. &ldquo;Could you give me some idea of
what it was like?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Willingly!&rdquo; said the old man. &ldquo;I will
describe to you the very last Hunt that took
place, before that form of Sport (for it was
actually reckoned among the <i>Sports</i> of the
day: we called it &lsquo;Cub-Hunting&rsquo;) was finally
abandoned. I witnessed it myself, as I happened
to be passing by at the moment, and
was what we called &lsquo;in at the death.&rsquo; I can
see it now!&rdquo; he went on in an excited tone,
gazing into vacancy with those large dreamy
eyes of his. &ldquo;It seems like yesterday; and
<span class="pb" id="Page_188">188</span>
yet it happened&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; He checked himself
hastily, and the remaining words died away
into a whisper.</p>

<p class="center small">SCHOLAR-HUNTING: THE PURSUED</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;<i>How</i> many years ago did you say?&rdquo; I
asked, much interested in the prospect of at
last learning <i>some</i> definite fact in his history.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_189">189</div>

</div>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Many</i> years ago,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;The scene
at the Railway-Station had been (so they told
me) one of wild excitement. Eight or nine
Heads of Colleges had assembled at the gates
(no one was allowed inside), and the Station-Master
had drawn a line on the pavement,
and insisted on their all standing behind it.
The gates were flung open! The young man
darted through them, and fled like lightning
down the street, while the Heads of Colleges
actually <i>yelled</i> with excitement on catching
sight of him! The Proctor gave the word,
in the old statutory form, &lsquo;<i>Semel!</i> <i>Bis!</i> <i>Ter!</i>
<i>Currite!</i>&rsquo;, and the Hunt began! Oh, it was
a fine sight, believe me! At the first corner
he dropped his Greek Lexicon: further on,
his railway-rug: then various small articles:
<span class="pb" id="Page_190">190</span>
then his umbrella: lastly, what I suppose he
prized most, his hand-bag: but the game was
up: the spherical Principal of&mdash;of&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of <i>which</i> College?&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&mdash;of <i>one</i> of the Colleges,&rdquo; he resumed,
&ldquo;had put into operation the Theory&mdash;his own
discovery&mdash;of Accelerated Velocity, and captured
him just opposite to where I stood. I
shall never forget that wild breathless struggle!
But it was soon over. Once in those great
bony hands, escape was impossible!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I ask why you speak of him as the
&lsquo;<i>spherical</i>&rsquo; Principal?&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The epithet referred to his <i>shape</i>, which
was a perfect <i>sphere</i>. You are aware that
a bullet, another instance of a perfect sphere,
when falling in a perfectly straight line, moves
with Accelerated Velocity?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I bowed assent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, my spherical friend (as I am proud
to call him) set himself to investigate the
<i>causes</i> of this. He found them to be <i>three</i>.
One; that it is a perfect <i>sphere</i>. Two; that
it moves in a <i>straight line</i>. Three; that its
direction is <i>not upwards</i>. When these three
<span class="pb" id="Page_191">191</span>
conditions are fulfilled, you get Accelerated
Velocity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hardly,&rdquo; I said: &ldquo;if you will excuse my
differing from you. Suppose we apply the
theory to <i>horizontal</i> motion. If a bullet is
fired <i>horizontally</i>, it&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&mdash;it does <i>not</i> move in a <i>straight line</i>,&rdquo;
he quietly finished my sentence for me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I yield the point,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;What did
your friend do next?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The next thing was to apply the theory,
as you rightly suggest, to <i>horizontal</i> motion.
But the moving body, ever tending to <i>fall</i>,
needs <i>constant support</i>, if it is to move in a
true horizontal line. &lsquo;What, then,&rsquo; he asked
himself, &lsquo;will <i>give constant support to a moving
body</i>?&rsquo; And his answer was &lsquo;<i>Human
legs!</i>&rsquo; <i>That</i> was the discovery that immortalised
his name!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;His name being&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo; I suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had not mentioned it,&rdquo; was the gentle
reply of my most unsatisfactory informant.
&ldquo;His next step was an obvious one. He
took to a diet of suet-dumplings, until his
body had become a perfect sphere. <i>Then</i>
<span class="pb" id="Page_192">192</span>
he went out for his first experimental run&mdash;which
nearly cost him his life!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How was <i>that</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you see, he had no idea of the <i>tremendous</i>
new Force in Nature that he was
calling into play. He began too fast. In a
very few minutes he found himself moving at
a hundred miles an hour! And, if he had
not had the presence of mind to charge into
the middle of a haystack (which he scattered
to the four winds) there can be no doubt that
he would have left the Planet he belonged to,
and gone right away into Space!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how came that to be the <i>last</i> of the
Cub-Hunts?&rdquo; I enquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you see, it led to a rather scandalous
dispute between two of the Colleges.
<i>Another</i> Principal had laid his hand on the
young man, so nearly at the same moment
as the <i>spherical</i> one, that there was no knowing
which had touched him first. The dispute
got into print, and did us no credit, and, in
short, Cub-Hunts came to an end. Now I&rsquo;ll
tell you what cured us of that wild craze of
ours, the bidding against each other, for the
<span class="pb" id="Page_193">193</span>
clever scholars, just as if they were articles
to be sold by auction! Just when the craze
had reached its highest point, and when one
of the Colleges had actually advertised a
Scholarship of one thousand pounds <i>per
annum</i>, one of our tourists brought us the
manuscript of an old African legend&mdash;I
happen to have a copy of it in my pocket.
Shall I translate it for you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pray go on,&rdquo; I said, though I felt I was
getting <i>very</i> sleepy.</p>

<br /><span class="small">WHAT TOTTLES MEANT.</span></h2>
<p>Mein Herr unrolled the manuscript, but, to
my great surprise, instead of <i>reading</i> it, he
began to <i>sing</i> it, in a rich mellow voice that
seemed to ring through the room.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;One thousand pounds per annuum</p>
<p class="t0">Is not so bad a figure, come!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="t0">Cried Tottles. &ldquo;And I tell you, flat,</p>

<p class="t0">The blissful Honey-moon is past:</p>
<p class="t0">The Pair have settled down at last:</p>

<p class="t0">&ldquo;Life is a very jolly game!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="t0">Cried happy Tottles (and he meant it).</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&lsquo;Contented with a frugal lot&rsquo;</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_196">196</div>
<p>Here, with one of those convulsive starts
that wake one up in the very act of dropping
off to sleep, I became conscious that the deep
musical tones that thrilled me did <i>not</i> belong
to Mein Herr, but to the French Count. The
old man was still conning the manuscript.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I <i>beg</i> your pardon for keeping you waiting!&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;I was just making sure that
I knew the English for all the words. I am
quite ready now.&rdquo; And he read me the following
Legend:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In a city that stands in the very centre
of Africa, and is rarely visited by the casual
tourist, the people had always bought eggs&mdash;a
daily necessary in a climate where egg-flip
was the usual diet&mdash;from a Merchant who
came to their gates once a week. And the
people always bid wildly against each other:
so there was quite a lively auction every time
the Merchant came, and the last egg in his
basket used to fetch the value of two or three
camels, or thereabouts. And eggs got dearer
every week. And still they drank their egg-flip,
and wondered where all their money
went to.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_197">197</div>
<div class="img" id="fig16">
<img src="images/i197.jpg" alt="THE EGG-MERCHANT" width="500" height="610" />
<p class="center small">THE EGG-MERCHANT</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;And there came a day when they put their
heads together. And they understood what
donkeys they had been.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And next day, when the Merchant came,
only <i>one</i> Man went forth. And he said &lsquo;Oh,
thou of the hook-nose and the goggle-eyes,
thou of the measureless beard, how much for
that lot of eggs?&rsquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_198">198</div>
<p>&ldquo;And the Merchant answered him &lsquo;I <i>could</i>
let thee have that lot at ten thousand piastres
the dozen.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the Man chuckled inwardly, and said
&lsquo;<i>Ten</i> piastres the dozen I offer thee, and no
more, oh descendant of a distinguished grandfather!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the Merchant stroked his beard, and
said &lsquo;Hum! I will await the coming of thy
friends,&rsquo; So he waited. And the Man waited
with him. And they waited both together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The manuscript breaks off here,&rdquo; said
Mein Herr, as he rolled it up again; &ldquo;but
it was enough to open our eyes. We saw
what simpletons we had been&mdash;buying our
Scholars much as those ignorant savages
bought their eggs&mdash;and the ruinous system
was abandoned. If only we could have abandoned,
along with it, all the <i>other</i> fashions we
had borrowed from you, instead of carrying
them to their logical results! But it was not
to be. What ruined my country, and drove
me from my home, was the introduction&mdash;into
the <i>Army</i>, of all places&mdash;of your theory
of Political Dichotomy!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_199">199</div>
<p>&ldquo;Shall I trouble you too much,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;if
I ask you to explain what you mean by &lsquo;the
Theory of Political Dichotomy&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No trouble at all!&rdquo; was Mein Herr&rsquo;s most
courteous reply. &ldquo;I quite enjoy talking, when
I get so good a listener. What started the
thing, with us, was the report brought to us,
by one of our most eminent statesmen, who
had stayed some time in England, of the way
affairs were managed there. It was a political
necessity (so he assured us, and we believed
him, though we had never discovered it till
that moment) that there should be <i>two</i> Parties,
in every affair and on every subject. In
<i>Politics</i>, the two Parties, which you had found
it necessary to institute, were called, he told
us, &lsquo;Whigs&rsquo; and &lsquo;Tories&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That must have been some time ago?&rdquo;
I remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It <i>was</i> some time ago,&rdquo; he admitted.
&ldquo;And this was the way the affairs of the
British Nation were managed. (You will
correct me if I misrepresent it. I do but
repeat what our traveler told us.) These
two Parties&mdash;which were in chronic hostility
<span class="pb" id="Page_200">200</span>
to each other&mdash;took turns in conducting the
Government; and the Party, that happened
<i>not</i> to be in power, was called the &lsquo;Opposition&rsquo;,
I believe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is the right name,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;There
have always been, so long as we have had a
Parliament at all, <i>two</i> Parties, one &lsquo;in&rsquo;, and
one &lsquo;out&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, the function of the &lsquo;Ins&rsquo; (if I may
so call them) was to do the best they could
for the national welfare&mdash;in such things as
making war or peace, commercial treaties, and
so forth?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Undoubtedly,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the function of the &lsquo;Outs&rsquo; was (so
our traveller assured us, though we were very
incredulous at first) to <i>prevent</i> the &lsquo;Ins&rsquo; from
succeeding in any of these things?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To <i>criticize</i> and to <i>amend</i> their proceedings,&rdquo;
I corrected him. &ldquo;It would be <i>unpatriotic</i>
to <i>hinder</i> the Government in doing
what was for the good of the Nation! We
have always held a <i>Patriot</i> to be the greatest
of heroes, and an <i>unpatriotic</i> spirit to be one
of the worst of human ills!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_201">201</div>
<p>&ldquo;Excuse me for a moment,&rdquo; the old gentleman
courteously replied, taking out his pocket-book.
&ldquo;I have a few memoranda here, of a
correspondence I had with our tourist, and,
if you will allow me, I&rsquo;ll just refresh my memory&mdash;although
I quite agree with you&mdash;it
is, as you say, one of the worst of human
ills&mdash;&rdquo; And, here Mein Herr began singing
again:&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">But oh, the worst of human ills</p>
<p class="t0">(Poor Tottles found) are &lsquo;little bills&rsquo;!</p>
<p class="t0">And, with no balance in the Bank,</p>
<p class="t0">What wonder that his spirits sank?</p>
<p class="t0">Still, as the money flowed away,</p>
<p class="t0">He wondered how on earth she spent it.</p>
<p class="t0">&ldquo;You cost me twenty pounds a day,</p>
<p class="t0"><span class="norm">At least</span>!&rdquo; cried Tottles (and he meant it).</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">She sighed. &ldquo;Those Drawing Rooms, you know!</p>
<p class="t0">I really never thought about it:</p>
<p class="t0">Mamma declared we ought to go&mdash;</p>
<p class="t0">We should be Nobodies without it.</p>
<p class="t0">That diamond-circlet for my brow&mdash;</p>
<p class="t0">I quite believed that <span class="norm">she</span> had sent it,</p>
<p class="t0">Until the Bill came in just now&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="t0">&ldquo;<span class="norm">Viper</span>!&rdquo; cried Tottles (and he meant it).</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_202">202</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Poor Mrs. T. could bear no more,</p>
<p class="t0">But fainted flat upon the floor.</p>
<p class="t0">Mamma-in-law, with anguish wild,</p>
<p class="t0">Seeks, all in vain, to rouse her child.</p>
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Quick! Take this box of smelling-salts!</p>
<p class="t0">Don&rsquo;t scold her, James, or you&rsquo;ll repent it,</p>
<p class="t0">She&rsquo;s a <span class="norm">dear</span> girl, with all her faults&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="t0">&ldquo;She <span class="norm">is</span>!&rdquo; groaned Tottles (and he meant it).</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;I was a donkey,&rdquo; Tottles cried,</p>
<p class="t0">&ldquo;To choose your daughter for my bride!</p>
<p class="t0">&rsquo;Twas <span class="norm">you</span> that bid us cut a dash!</p>
<p class="t0">&rsquo;Tis <span class="norm">you</span> have brought us to this smash!</p>
<p class="t0">You don&rsquo;t suggest one single thing</p>
<p class="t0">That can in any way prevent it&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p class="t0">Then what&rsquo;s the use of arguing?</p>
<p class="t0"><span class="norm">Shut up!</span>&rdquo; cried Tottles (and he meant it).</p>
</div>
<p>Once more I started into wakefulness, and
realised that Mein Herr was not the singer.
He was still consulting his memoranda.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is exactly what my friend told me,&rdquo; he
resumed, after conning over various papers.
&ldquo;&lsquo;<i>Unpatriotic</i>&rsquo; is the very word I had used,
in writing to him, and &lsquo;<i>hinder</i>&rsquo; is the very
word he used in his reply! Allow me to read
you a portion of his letter:&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_203">203</div>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;<i>I can assure you</i>,&rsquo; he writes, &lsquo;<i>that, unpatriotic
as you may think it, the recognised
function of the &lsquo;Opposition&rsquo; is to hinder, in every
manner not forbidden by the Law, the
action of the Government. This process is
called &lsquo;Legitimate Obstruction&rsquo;: and the greatest
triumph the &lsquo;Opposition&rsquo; can ever enjoy,
is when they are able to point out that, owing
to their &lsquo;Obstruction&rsquo;, the Government have
failed in everything they have tried to do for
the good of the Nation!</i>&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Your friend has not put it <i>quite</i> correctly,&rdquo;
I said. &ldquo;The Opposition would no doubt be
glad to point out that the Government had
failed <i>through their own fault</i>; but <i>not</i> that
they had failed on account of <i>Obstruction</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think so?&rdquo; he gently replied. &ldquo;Allow
me now to read to you this newspaper-cutting,
which my friend enclosed in his letter. It is
part of the report of a public speech, made
by a Statesman who was at the time a member
of the &lsquo;Opposition&rsquo;:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;<i>At the close of the Session, he thought
they had no reason to be discontented with the
<span class="pb" id="Page_204">204</span>
fortunes of the campaign. They had routed
the enemy at every point. But the pursuit
must be continued. They had only to follow
up a disordered and dispirited foe.</i>&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Now to what portion of your national
history would you guess that the speaker
was referring?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really, the number of <i>successful</i> wars we
have waged during the last century,&rdquo; I replied,
with a glow of British pride, &ldquo;is <i>far</i> too great
for me to guess, with any chance of success,
<i>which</i> it was we were then engaged in. However,
I will name &lsquo;<i>India</i>&rsquo; as the most probable.
The Mutiny was no doubt, all but
crushed, at the time that speech was made.
What a fine, manly, <i>patriotic</i> speech it must
have been!&rdquo; I exclaimed in an outburst
of enthusiasm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think so?&rdquo; he replied, in a tone of
gentle pity. &ldquo;Yet my friend tells me that
the &lsquo;<i>disordered and dispirited foe</i>&rsquo; simply
meant the Statesmen who happened to be in
power at the moment; that the &lsquo;<i>pursuit</i>&rsquo;
simply meant &lsquo;Obstruction&rsquo;; and that the
<span class="pb" id="Page_205">205</span>
words &lsquo;<i>they had routed the enemy</i>&rsquo; simply
meant that the &lsquo;Opposition&rsquo; had succeeded in
hindering the Government from doing any of
the work which the Nation had empowered
them to do!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I thought it best to say nothing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seemed queer to <i>us</i>, just at first,&rdquo; he
resumed, after courteously waiting a minute
for me to speak: &ldquo;but, when once we had mastered
the idea, our respect for your Nation
was so great that we carried it into every
department of life! It was &lsquo;<i>the beginning of
the end</i>&rsquo; with us. My country never held up
its head again!&rdquo; And the poor old gentleman
sighed deeply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us change the subject,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Do
not distress yourself, I beg!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; he said, with an effort to recover
himself. &ldquo;I had rather finish my story! The
next step (after reducing our Government to
impotence, and putting a stop to all useful
legislation, which did not take us long to do)
was to introduce what we called &lsquo;the glorious
British Principle of Dichotomy&rsquo; into <i>Agriculture</i>.
We persuaded many of the well-to-do
<span class="pb" id="Page_206">206</span>
farmers to divide their staff of labourers into
two Parties, and to set them one against the
other. They were called, like our political
Parties, the &lsquo;Ins&rsquo; and the &lsquo;Outs&rsquo;: the business
of the &lsquo;Ins&rsquo; was to do as much of ploughing,
sowing, or whatever might be needed, as they
could manage in a day, and at night they were
paid according to the amount they had <i>done</i>:
the business of the &lsquo;Outs&rsquo; was to hinder them,
and <i>they</i> were paid for the amount they had
<i>hindered</i>. The farmers found they had to pay
only <i>half</i> as much wages as they did before,
and they didn&rsquo;t observe that the amount of
work done was only a <i>quarter</i> as much as was
done before: so they took it up quite enthusiastically,
<i>at first</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And <i>afterwards</i>&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo; I enquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, <i>afterwards</i> they didn&rsquo;t like it quite
so well. In a very short time, things settled
down into a regular routine. No work <i>at all</i>
was done. So the &lsquo;Ins&rsquo; got no wages, and
the &lsquo;Outs&rsquo; got full pay. And the farmers
never discovered, till most of them were
ruined, that the rascals had agreed to manage
it so, and had shared the pay between them!
<span class="pb" id="Page_207">207</span>
While the thing lasted, there were funny sights
to be seen! Why, I&rsquo;ve often watched a
ploughman, with two horses harnessed to the
plough, doing his best to get it <i>forwards</i>; while
the opposition-ploughman, with three donkeys
harnessed at the <i>other</i> end, was doing <i>his</i> best
to get it <i>backwards</i>! And the plough never
moving an inch, <i>either</i> way!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But <i>we</i> never did anything like <i>that</i>!&rdquo; I
exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Simply because you were less <i>logical</i> than
we were,&rdquo; replied Mein Herr. &ldquo;There is
<i>sometimes</i> an advantage in being a donk&mdash;Excuse
me! No <i>personal</i> allusion intended.
All this happened <i>long ago</i>, you know!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did the Dichotomy-Principle succeed in
<i>any</i> direction?&rdquo; I enquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In <i>none</i>,&rdquo; Mein Herr candidly confessed.
&ldquo;It had a <i>very</i> short trial in <i>Commerce</i>. The
shop-keepers <i>wouldn&rsquo;t</i> take it up, after once
trying the plan of having half the attendants
busy in folding up and carrying away the
goods which the other half were trying to
spread out upon the counters. They said the
Public didn&rsquo;t like it!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_208">208</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wonder at it,&rdquo; I remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we tried &lsquo;the British Principle&rsquo; for
some years. And the end of it all was&mdash;&rdquo;
His voice suddenly dropped, almost to a
whisper; and large tears began to roll down
his cheeks. &ldquo;&mdash;the end was that we got involved
in a war; and there was a great battle,
in which we far out-numbered the enemy.
But what could one expect, when only <i>half</i> of
our soldiers were fighting, and the other half
pulling them back? It ended in a crushing
defeat&mdash;an utter rout. This caused a Revolution;
and most of the Government were
banished. I myself was accused of Treason,
for having so strongly advocated &lsquo;the British
Principle.&rsquo; My property was all forfeited,
and&mdash;and&mdash;I was driven into exile! &lsquo;Now
the mischief&rsquo;s done,&rsquo; they said, &lsquo;perhaps you&rsquo;ll
kindly leave the country?&rsquo; It nearly broke
my heart, but I had to go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The melancholy tone became a wail: the
wail became a chant: the chant became a
song&mdash;though whether it was <i>Mein Herr</i> that
was singing, this time, or somebody else, I
could not feel certain.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_209">209</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;And, now the mischief&rsquo;s done, perhaps</p>
<p class="t0">You&rsquo;ll kindly go and pack your traps?</p>
<p class="t0">Since <span class="norm">two</span> (your daughter and your son)</p>
<p class="t0">Are Company, but <span class="norm">three</span> are none.</p>
<p class="t0">A course of saving we&rsquo;ll begin:</p>
<p class="t0">When change is needed, <span class="norm">I&rsquo;ll</span> invent it:</p>
<p class="t0">Don&rsquo;t think to put <span class="norm">your</span> finger in</p>
<p class="t0"><span class="norm">This</span> pie!&rdquo; cried Tottles (and he meant it).</p>
</div>
<p>The music seemed to die away. Mein Herr
was again speaking in his ordinary voice.
&ldquo;Now tell me one thing more,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Am
I right in thinking that in <i>your</i> Universities,
though a man may reside some thirty or forty
years, you examine him, once for all, at the
end of the first three or four?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is so, undoubtedly,&rdquo; I admitted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Practically, then, you examine a man at the
<i>beginning</i> of his career!&rdquo; the old man said
to himself rather than to me. &ldquo;And what
guarantee have you that he <i>retains</i> the knowledge
for which you have rewarded him&mdash;beforehand,
as <i>we</i> should say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None,&rdquo; I admitted, feeling a little puzzled
at the drift of his remarks. &ldquo;How do <i>you</i>
secure that object?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_210">210</div>
<p>&ldquo;By examining him at the <i>end</i> of his thirty
or forty years&mdash;not at the beginning,&rdquo; he
gently replied. &ldquo;On an average, the knowledge
then found is about one-fifth of what
it was at first&mdash;the process of forgetting
going on at a very steady uniform rate&mdash;and
he, who forgets <i>least</i>, gets <i>most</i> honour, and
most rewards.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you give him the money when he
needs it no longer? And you make him live
most of his life on <i>nothing</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hardly that. He gives his orders to the
tradesmen: they supply him, for forty, sometimes
fifty, years, at their own risk: then he
gets his Fellowship&mdash;which pays him in <i>one</i>
year as much as <i>your</i> Fellowships pay in fifty&mdash;and
then he can easily pay all his bills,
with interest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But suppose he fails to get his Fellowship?
That must occasionally happen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That occasionally happens.&rdquo; It was Mein
Herr&rsquo;s turn, now, to make admissions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what becomes of the tradesmen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They calculate accordingly. When a man
appears to be getting alarmingly ignorant, or
<span class="pb" id="Page_211">211</span>
stupid, they will sometimes refuse to supply
him any longer. You have no idea with what
enthusiasm a man will begin to rub up his
forgotten sciences or languages, when his
butcher has cut off the supply of beef and
mutton!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And who are the Examiners?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The young men who have just come,
brimming over with knowledge. You would
think it a curious sight,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;to
see mere boys examining such old men. I
have known a man set to examine his own
grandfather. It was a little painful for both
of them, no doubt. The old gentleman was
as bald as a coot&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How bald would that be?&rdquo; I&rsquo;ve no idea
why I asked this question. I felt I was getting
foolish.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_212">212</div>
<h2 id="c14">CHAPTER XIV.
<br /><span class="small">BRUNO&rsquo;S PICNIC.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;As bald as bald,&rdquo; was the bewildering
reply. &ldquo;Now, Bruno, I&rsquo;ll tell you a story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll tell <i>oo</i> a story,&rdquo; said Bruno, beginning
in a great hurry for fear of Sylvie getting
the start of him: &ldquo;once there were a Mouse&mdash;a
little tiny Mouse&mdash;such a tiny little Mouse!
Oo never saw such a tiny Mouse&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did nothing ever happen to it, Bruno?&rdquo; I
asked. &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you anything more to tell
us, besides its being so tiny?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing never happened to it,&rdquo; Bruno
solemnly replied.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_213">213</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why did nothing never happen to it?&rdquo; said
Sylvie, who was sitting, with her head on
Bruno&rsquo;s shoulder, patiently waiting for a chance
of beginning <i>her</i> story.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It were too tiny,&rdquo; Bruno explained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>That&rsquo;s</i> no reason!&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;However
tiny it was, things might happen to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bruno looked pityingly at me, as if he thought
me very stupid. &ldquo;It were too tiny,&rdquo; he repeated.
&ldquo;If anything happened to it, it would die&mdash;it
were so <i>very</i> tiny!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really that&rsquo;s enough about its being tiny!&rdquo;
Sylvie put in. &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you invented any more
about it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t invented no more yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well then, you shouldn&rsquo;t begin a story till
you&rsquo;ve invented more! Now be quiet, there&rsquo;s
a good boy, and listen to <i>my</i> story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Bruno, having quite exhausted all his
inventive faculty, by beginning in too great
a hurry, quietly resigned himself to listening.
&ldquo;Tell about the other Bruno, please,&rdquo; he said
coaxingly.</p>
<p>Sylvie put her arms round his neck, and
began:&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_214">214</div>
<p>&ldquo;The wind was whispering among the trees,&rdquo;
(&ldquo;That wasn&rsquo;t good manners!&rdquo; Bruno interrupted.
&ldquo;Never mind about manners,&rdquo; said
Sylvie) &ldquo;and it was evening&mdash;a nice moony
evening, and the Owls were hooting&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pretend they weren&rsquo;t Owls!&rdquo; Bruno pleaded,
stroking her cheek with his fat little hand. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t like Owls. Owls have such great big eyes.
Pretend they were Chickens!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you afraid of their great big eyes,
Bruno?&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t <i>&rsquo;fraid</i> of nothing,&rdquo; Bruno answered in
as careless a tone as he could manage: &ldquo;they&rsquo;re
ugly with their great big eyes. I think if they
cried, the tears would be as big&mdash;oh, as big as
the moon!&rdquo; And he laughed merrily. &ldquo;Doos
Owls cry ever, Mister Sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Owls cry never,&rdquo; I said gravely, trying to
copy Bruno&rsquo;s way of speaking: &ldquo;they&rsquo;ve got
nothing to be sorry for, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but they have!&rdquo; Bruno exclaimed.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;re ever so sorry, &rsquo;cause they killed the
poor little Mouses!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But they&rsquo;re not sorry when they&rsquo;re <i>hungry</i>,
I suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_215">215</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oo don&rsquo;t know nothing about Owls!&rdquo; Bruno
scornfully remarked. &ldquo;When they&rsquo;re hungry,
they&rsquo;re very, <i>very</i> sorry they killed the little
Mouses, &rsquo;cause if they <i>hadn&rsquo;t</i> killed them there&rsquo;d
be sumfin for supper, oo know!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bruno was evidently getting into a dangerously
inventive state of mind, so Sylvie broke in
with &ldquo;Now I&rsquo;m going on with the story. So
the Owls&mdash;the Chickens, I mean&mdash;were looking
to see if they could find a nice fat Mouse
for their supper&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pretend it was a nice &rsquo;abbit!&rdquo; said Bruno.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it <i>wasn&rsquo;t</i> a nice habit, to kill Mouses,&rdquo;
Sylvie argued. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t pretend <i>that</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say &lsquo;<i>habit</i>,&rsquo; oo silly fellow!&rdquo; Bruno
replied with a merry twinkle in his eye. &ldquo;&rsquo;<i>abbits</i>&mdash;that
runs about in the fields!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rabbit? Well it can be a Rabbit, if you like.
But you mustn&rsquo;t alter my story so much, Bruno.
A Chicken <i>couldn&rsquo;t</i> eat a Rabbit!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it might have wished to see if it could
try to eat it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it wished to see if it could try&mdash;oh,
really, Bruno, that&rsquo;s nonsense! I shall go back
to the Owls.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_216">216</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well then, pretend they hadn&rsquo;t great eyes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And they saw a little Boy,&rdquo; Sylvie went
on, disdaining to make any further corrections.
&ldquo;And he asked them to tell him a story. And
the Owls hooted and flew away&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; (&ldquo;Oo
shouldn&rsquo;t say &lsquo;<i>flewed</i>;&rsquo; oo should say &lsquo;<i>flied</i>,&rsquo;&rdquo;
Bruno whispered. But Sylvie wouldn&rsquo;t hear.)
&ldquo;And he met a Lion. And he asked the Lion
to tell him a story. And the Lion said &lsquo;yes,&rsquo;
it would. And, while the Lion was telling him
the story, it nibbled some of his head off&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say &lsquo;nibbled&rsquo;!&rdquo; Bruno entreated.
&ldquo;Only little things nibble&mdash;little thin sharp
things, with edges&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well then, it &lsquo;<i>nubbled</i>,&rsquo;&rdquo; said Sylvie. &ldquo;And
when it had nubbled <i>all</i> his head off, he went
away, and he never said &lsquo;thank you&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That were very rude,&rdquo; said Bruno. &ldquo;If he
couldn&rsquo;t speak, he might have nodded&mdash;no,
he couldn&rsquo;t nod. Well, he might have shaked
<i>hands</i> with the Lion!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;d forgotten that part!&rdquo; said Sylvie.
&ldquo;He <i>did</i> shake hands with it. He came back
again, you know, and he thanked the Lion very
much, for telling him the story.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_217">217</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then his head had growed up again?&rdquo; said
Bruno.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, it grew up in a minute. And the
Lion begged pardon, and said it wouldn&rsquo;t nubble
off little boys&rsquo; heads&mdash;not never no more!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bruno looked much pleased at this change of
events. &ldquo;Now that are a <i>really</i> nice story!&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;<i>Aren&rsquo;t</i> it a nice story, Mister Sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I would like to hear another
story about that Boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So would <i>I</i>,&rdquo; said Bruno, stroking Sylvie&rsquo;s
cheek again. &ldquo;<i>Please</i> tell about Bruno&rsquo;s Picnic;
and don&rsquo;t talk about <i>nubbly</i> Lions!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t, if it frightens you,&rdquo; said Sylvie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Flightens</i> me!&rdquo; Bruno exclaimed indignantly.
&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t <i>that</i>! It&rsquo;s &rsquo;cause &lsquo;nubbly&rsquo; &rsquo;s
such a grumbly word to say&mdash;when one person&rsquo;s
got her head on another person&rsquo;s shoulder.
When she talks like that,&rdquo; he explained
to me, &ldquo;the talking goes down bofe sides of
my face&mdash;all the way to my chin&mdash;and it
<i>doos</i> tickle so! It&rsquo;s enough to make a beard
grow, that it is!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He said this with great severity, but it was
evidently meant for a joke: so Sylvie laughed&mdash;a
<span class="pb" id="Page_218">218</span>
delicious musical little laugh, and laid her
soft cheek on the top of her brother&rsquo;s curly
head, as if it were a pillow, while she went on
with the story. &ldquo;So this Boy&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it wasn&rsquo;t <i>me</i>, oo know!&rdquo; Bruno interrupted.
&ldquo;And oo needn&rsquo;t try to look as if
it was, Mister Sir!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I represented, respectfully, that I was trying
to look as if it wasn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&mdash;he was a middling good Boy&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He were a <i>welly</i> good Boy!&rdquo; Bruno corrected
her. &ldquo;And he never did nothing he
wasn&rsquo;t told to do&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>That</i> doesn&rsquo;t make a good Boy!&rdquo; Sylvie
said contemptuously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That <i>do</i> make a good Boy!&rdquo; Bruno insisted.</p>
<p>Sylvie gave up the point. &ldquo;Well, he was
a <i>very</i> good Boy, and he always kept his promises,
and he had a big cupboard&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&mdash;for to keep all his promises in!&rdquo; cried
Bruno.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he kept <i>all</i> his promises,&rdquo; Sylvie said,
with a mischievous look in her eyes, &ldquo;he wasn&rsquo;t
like <i>some</i> Boys I know of!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_219">219</div>
<p>&ldquo;He had to put <i>salt</i> with them, a-course,&rdquo;
Bruno said gravely: &ldquo;oo ca&rsquo;n&rsquo;t keep promises
when there isn&rsquo;t any salt. And he kept his
birthday on the second shelf.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long did he keep his birthday?&rdquo; I
asked. &ldquo;I never can keep <i>mine</i> more than
twenty-four hours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, a birthday <i>stays</i> that long by itself!&rdquo;
cried Bruno. &ldquo;Oo doosn&rsquo;t know how to keep
birthdays! This Boy kept <i>his</i> a whole year!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then the next birthday would begin,&rdquo;
said Sylvie. &ldquo;So it would be his birthday
<i>always</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So it were,&rdquo; said Bruno. &ldquo;Doos <i>oo</i> have
treats on <i>oor</i> birthday, Mister Sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sometimes,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When oo&rsquo;re <i>good</i>, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, it <i>is</i> a sort of treat, being good, isn&rsquo;t
it?&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A sort of <i>treat</i>!&rdquo; Bruno repeated. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
a sort of <i>punishment</i>, <i>I</i> think!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Bruno!&rdquo; Sylvie interrupted, almost
sadly. &ldquo;How <i>can</i> you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, but it <i>is</i>,&rdquo; Bruno persisted. &ldquo;Why,
look here, Mister Sir! <i>This</i> is being good!&rdquo;
<span class="pb" id="Page_220">220</span>
And he sat bolt upright, and put on an
absurdly solemn face. &ldquo;First oo must sit up
as straight as pokers&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&mdash;as <i>a</i> poker,&rdquo; Sylvie corrected him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&mdash;as straight as <i>pokers</i>,&rdquo; Bruno firmly
repeated. &ldquo;Then oo must clasp oor hands&mdash;<i>so</i>.
Then&mdash;&lsquo;Why hasn&rsquo;t oo brushed oor
hair? Go and brush it <i>toreckly</i>!&rsquo; Then&mdash;&lsquo;Oh,
Bruno, oo mustn&rsquo;t dog&rsquo;s-ear the daisies!&rsquo;
Did oo learn <i>oor</i> spelling wiz daisies, Mister
Sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to hear about that Boy&rsquo;s <i>Birthday</i>,&rdquo;
I said.</p>
<p>Bruno returned to the story instantly.
&ldquo;Well, so this Boy said &lsquo;Now it&rsquo;s my Birthday!&rsquo;
And so&mdash;I&rsquo;m tired!&rdquo; he suddenly broke
off, laying his head in Sylvie&rsquo;s lap. &ldquo;Sylvie
knows it best. Sylvie&rsquo;s grown-upper than me.
Go on, Sylvie!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sylvie patiently took up the thread of the
story again. &ldquo;So he said &lsquo;Now it&rsquo;s my
Birthday. Whatever shall I do to keep my
Birthday? All <i>good</i> little Boys&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; (Sylvie
turned away from Bruno, and made a great pretence
of whispering to <i>me</i>) &ldquo;&mdash;all <i>good</i> little
<span class="pb" id="Page_221">221</span>
Boys&mdash;Boys that learn their lessons quite
perfect&mdash;they always keep their birthdays,
you know. So of course <i>this</i> little Boy kept
<i>his</i> Birthday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oo may call him Bruno, if oo like,&rdquo; the
little fellow carelessly remarked. &ldquo;It weren&rsquo;t
<i>me</i>, but it makes it more interesting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So Bruno said to himself &lsquo;The properest
thing to do is to have a Picnic, all by myself,
on the top of the hill. And I&rsquo;ll take some
Milk, and some Bread, and some Apples: and
first and foremost, I want some <i>Milk</i>!&rsquo; So,
first and foremost, Bruno took a milk-pail&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he went and milkted the Cow!&rdquo;
Bruno put in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Sylvie, meekly accepting the
new verb. &ldquo;And the Cow said &lsquo;Moo! What
are you going to do with all that Milk?&rsquo; And
Bruno said &lsquo;Please&rsquo;m, I want it for my Picnic.&rsquo;
And the Cow said &lsquo;Moo! But I hope you
wo&rsquo;n&rsquo;t <i>boil</i> any of it?&rsquo; And Bruno said &lsquo;No,
<i>indeed</i> I won&rsquo;t! New Milk&rsquo;s so nice and so
warm, it wants no boiling!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t want no boiling,&rdquo; Bruno offered
as an amended version.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_222">222</div>
<p>&ldquo;So Bruno put the Milk in a bottle. And
then Bruno said &lsquo;Now I want some Bread!&rsquo;
So he went to the Oven, and he took out a
delicious new Loaf. And the Oven&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&mdash;ever so light and so puffy!&rdquo; Bruno
impatiently corrected her. &ldquo;Oo shouldn&rsquo;t
leave out so many words!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sylvie humbly apologised. &ldquo;&mdash;a delicious
new Loaf, ever so light and so puffy. And
the Oven said&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Here Sylvie made a long
pause. &ldquo;Really I don&rsquo;t know <i>what</i> an Oven
begins with, when it wants to speak!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both children looked appealingly at me; but
I could only say, helplessly, &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t the
least idea! <i>I</i> never heard an Oven speak!&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a minute or two we all sat silent; and
then Bruno said, very softly, &ldquo;Oven begins
wiz &lsquo;O&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Good</i> little boy!&rdquo; Sylvie exclaimed. &ldquo;He
does his spelling <i>very</i> nicely. <i>He&rsquo;s cleverer
than he knows!</i>&rdquo; she added, aside, to <i>me</i>.
&ldquo;So the Oven said &lsquo;O! What are you going
to do with all that Bread?&rsquo; And Bruno said
&lsquo;Please&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; Is an Oven &lsquo;Sir&rsquo; or &lsquo;&rsquo;m,&rsquo; would
you say?&rdquo; She looked to me for a reply.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_223">223</div>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Both</i>, I think,&rdquo; seemed to me the safest
thing to say.</p>
<p>Sylvie adopted the suggestion instantly.
&ldquo;So Bruno said &lsquo;Please, Sirm, I want it for
my Picnic.&rsquo; And the Oven said &lsquo;O! But I
hope you wo&rsquo;n&rsquo;t <i>toast</i> any of it?&rsquo; And Bruno
said &lsquo;No, <i>indeed</i> I wo&rsquo;n&rsquo;t! New Bread&rsquo;s so
light and so puffy, it wants no toasting!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It never doesn&rsquo;t want no toasting,&rdquo; said
Bruno. &ldquo;I <i>wiss</i> oo wouldn&rsquo;t say it so short!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So Bruno put the Bread in the hamper.
Then Bruno said &lsquo;Now I want some Apples!&rsquo;
So he took the hamper, and he went to the
Apple-Tree, and he picked some lovely ripe
Apples. And the Apple-Tree said&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Here
followed another long pause.</p>
<p>Bruno adopted his favourite expedient of
tapping his forehead; while Sylvie gazed
earnestly upwards, as if she hoped for some
suggestion from the birds, who were singing
merrily among the branches overhead. But
no result followed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What <i>does</i> an Apple-tree begin with, when
it wants to speak?&rdquo; Sylvie murmured despairingly,
to the irresponsive birds.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_224">224</div>
<p>At last, taking a leaf out of Bruno&rsquo;s book,
I ventured on a remark. &ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t &lsquo;Apple-tree&rsquo;
always begin with &lsquo;Eh!&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, of <i>course</i> it does! How <i>clever</i> of
you!&rdquo; Sylvie cried delightedly.</p>
<p>Bruno jumped up, and patted me on the
head. I tried not to feel conceited.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So the Apple Tree said &lsquo;Eh! What are
you going to do with all those Apples?&rsquo; And
Bruno said &lsquo;Please, Sir, I want them for
my Picnic,&rsquo; And the Apple-Tree said &lsquo;Eh!
But I hope you wo&rsquo;n&rsquo;t <i>bake</i> any of them?&rsquo;
And Bruno said &lsquo;No, <i>indeed</i> I wo&rsquo;n&rsquo;t! Ripe
Apples are so nice and so sweet, they want
no baking!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They never doesn&rsquo;t&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Bruno was beginning,
but Sylvie corrected herself before
he could get the words out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;They never doesn&rsquo;t nonow want no
baking.&rsquo; So Bruno put the Apples in the
hamper, along with the Bread, and the bottle
of Milk. And he set off to have a Picnic,
on the top of the hill, all by himself&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He wasn&rsquo;t greedy, oo know, to have it all
by himself,&rdquo; Bruno said, patting me on the
<span class="pb" id="Page_225">225</span>
cheek to call my attention; &ldquo;&rsquo;cause he hadn&rsquo;t
got no brothers and sisters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was very sad to have no <i>sisters</i>, wasn&rsquo;t
it?&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Bruno said thoughtfully;
&ldquo;&rsquo;cause he hadn&rsquo;t no lessons to do. So
he didn&rsquo;t mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sylvie went on. &ldquo;So, as he was walking
along the road, he heard behind him such a
curious sort of noise&mdash;a sort of a Thump!
Thump! Thump! &lsquo;Whatever <i>is</i> that?&rsquo; said
Bruno. &lsquo;Oh, I know!&rsquo; said Bruno. &lsquo;Why,
it&rsquo;s only my Watch a-ticking!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Were</i> it his Watch a-ticking?&rdquo; Bruno
asked me, with eyes that fairly sparkled with
mischievous delight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No doubt of it!&rdquo; I replied. And Bruno
laughed exultingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then Bruno thought a little harder. And
he said &lsquo;No! It <i>ca&rsquo;n&rsquo;t</i> be my Watch a-ticking;
because I haven&rsquo;t <i>got</i> a Watch!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bruno peered up anxiously into my face,
to see how I took it. I hung my head, and
put a thumb into my mouth, to the evident
delight of the little fellow.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_226">226</div>
<p>&ldquo;So Bruno went a little further along the
road. And then he heard it again, that queer
noise&mdash;Thump! Thump! Thump! &lsquo;What
ever <i>is</i> that?&rsquo; said Bruno. &lsquo;Oh, I know!&rsquo;
said Bruno. &lsquo;Why, it&rsquo;s only the Carpenter
a-mending my Wheelbarrow!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Were</i> it the Carterpenter a-mending his
Wheelbarrow?&rdquo; Bruno asked me.</p>
<p>I brightened up, and said &ldquo;It <i>must</i> have
been!&rdquo; in a tone of absolute conviction.</p>
<p>Bruno threw his arms round Sylvie&rsquo;s neck.
&ldquo;Sylvie!&rdquo; he said, in a perfectly audible
whisper. &ldquo;He says it <i>must</i> have been!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then Bruno thought a little harder. And
he said &lsquo;No! It <i>ca&rsquo;n&rsquo;t</i> be the Carpenter
amending my Wheelbarrow, because I haven&rsquo;t
<i>got</i> a Wheelbarrow!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>This time I hid my face in my hands, quite
unable to meet Bruno&rsquo;s look of triumph.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So Bruno went a little further along the
road. And then he heard that queer noise
again&mdash;Thump! Thump! Thump! So he
thought he&rsquo;d look round, <i>this</i> time, just to <i>see</i>
what it was. And what should it be but a
great Lion!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_227">227</div>
<p>&ldquo;A great big Lion,&rdquo; Bruno corrected her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A great big Lion. And Bruno was ever
so frightened, and he ran&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, he wasn&rsquo;t <i>flightened</i> a bit!&rdquo; Bruno
interrupted. (He was evidently anxious for
the reputation of his namesake.) &ldquo;He runned
away to get a good look at the Lion; &rsquo;cause
he wanted to see if it were the same Lion
what used to nubble little Boys&rsquo; heads off; and
he wanted to know how big it was!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, he ran away, to get a good look at
the Lion. And the Lion trotted slowly after
him. And the Lion called after him, in a very
gentle voice, &lsquo;Little Boy, little Boy! You
needn&rsquo;t be afraid of <i>me</i>! I&rsquo;m a very <i>gentle</i>
old Lion now. I <i>never</i> nubble little Boys&rsquo;
heads off, as I used to do.&rsquo; And so Bruno
said &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you <i>really</i>, Sir? Then what do
you live on?&rsquo; And the Lion&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oo <i>see</i> he weren&rsquo;t a bit flightened!&rdquo;
Bruno said to me, patting my cheek again.
&ldquo;&rsquo;cause he remembered to call it &lsquo;Sir,&rsquo; oo
know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I said that no doubt that was the <i>real</i> test
whether a person was frightened or not.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_228">228</div>
<p>&ldquo;And the Lion said &lsquo;Oh, I live on bread-and-butter,
and cherries, and marmalade, and
plum-cake&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&mdash;and <i>apples</i>!&rdquo; Bruno put in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, &lsquo;and apples.&rsquo; And Bruno said &lsquo;Won&rsquo;t
you come with me to my Picnic?&rsquo; And the
Lion said &lsquo;Oh, I should like it <i>very much indeed</i>!&rsquo;
And Bruno and the Lion went away
together.&rdquo; Sylvie stopped suddenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that <i>all</i>?&rdquo; I asked, despondingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not <i>quite</i> all,&rdquo; Sylvie slily replied. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
a sentence or two more. Isn&rsquo;t there, Bruno?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; with a carelessness that was evidently
put on: &ldquo;just a sentence or two more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And, as they were walking along, they
looked over a hedge, and who should they see
but a little black Lamb! And the Lamb was
ever so frightened. And it ran&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It were <i>really</i> flightened!&rdquo; Bruno put in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It ran away. And Bruno ran after it. And
he called &lsquo;Little Lamb! You needn&rsquo;t be afraid
of <i>this</i> Lion! It <i>never</i> kills things! It lives
on cherries, and marmalade&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&mdash;and <i>apples</i>!&rdquo; said Bruno. &ldquo;Oo
<i>always</i> forgets the apples!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_229">229</div>
<p>&ldquo;And Bruno said &lsquo;Wo&rsquo;n&rsquo;t you come with
us to my Picnic?&rsquo; And the Lamb said &lsquo;Oh,
I should like it <i>very much indeed</i>, if my Ma
will let me!&rsquo; And Bruno said &lsquo;Let&rsquo;s go and
ask your Ma!&rsquo; And they went to the old
Sheep. And Bruno said &lsquo;Please, may your
little Lamb come to my Picnic?&rsquo; And the
Sheep said &lsquo;Yes, if it&rsquo;s learnt all its lessons.&rsquo;
And the Lamb said &lsquo;Oh yes, Ma! I&rsquo;ve learnt
<i>all</i> my lessons!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pretend it hadn&rsquo;t any lessons!&rdquo; Bruno
earnestly pleaded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that would never do!&rdquo; said Sylvie.
&ldquo;I ca&rsquo;n&rsquo;t leave out all about the lessons! And
the old Sheep said &lsquo;Do you know your A B C
yet? Have you learnt A?&rsquo; And the Lamb
said &lsquo;Oh yes, Ma! I went to the A-field, and
I helped them to make A!&rsquo; &lsquo;Very good, my
child! And have you learnt B?&rsquo; &lsquo;Oh yes,
Ma! I went to the B-hive, and the B gave me
some honey!&rsquo; &lsquo;Very good, my child! And
have you learnt C?&rsquo; &lsquo;Oh yes, Ma! I went
to the C-side, and I saw the ships sailing on
the C!&rsquo; &lsquo;Very good, my child! You may go
to Bruno&rsquo;s Picnic.&rsquo;</p>

</div>
<p>&ldquo;So they set off. And Bruno walked in the
middle, so that the Lamb mightn&rsquo;t see the
Lion&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It were <i>flightened</i>,&rdquo; Bruno explained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and it trembled so; and it got paler
and paler; and, before they&rsquo;d got to the top
of the hill, it was a <i>white</i> little Lamb&mdash;as
white as snow!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_231">231</div>
<p>&ldquo;But <i>Bruno</i> weren&rsquo;t flightened!&rdquo; said the
owner of that name. &ldquo;So <i>he</i> staid black!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, he <i>didn&rsquo;t</i> stay black! He staid <i>pink</i>!&rdquo;
laughed Sylvie. &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t kiss you like this,
you know, if you were <i>black</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oo&rsquo;d <i>have</i> to!&rdquo; Bruno said with great decision.
&ldquo;Besides, Bruno wasn&rsquo;t <i>Bruno</i>, oo
know&mdash;I mean, Bruno wasn&rsquo;t <i>me</i>&mdash;I mean&mdash;don&rsquo;t
talk nonsense, Sylvie!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t do it again!&rdquo; Sylvie said very
humbly. &ldquo;And so, as they went along, the
Lion said &lsquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ll tell you what I used to do
when I was a young Lion. I used to hide behind
trees, to watch for little Boys.&rsquo;&rdquo; (Bruno
cuddled a little closer to her.) &ldquo;&lsquo;And, if a
little thin scraggy Boy came by, why, I used
to let him go. But, if a little fat juicy&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bruno could bear no more. &ldquo;Pretend he
wasn&rsquo;t juicy!&rdquo; he pleaded, half-sobbing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense, Bruno!&rdquo; Sylvie briskly replied.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be done in a moment! &lsquo;&mdash;if a little
fat juicy Boy came by, why, I used to spring
out and gobble him up! Oh, you&rsquo;ve no <i>idea</i>
what a delicious thing it is&mdash;a little juicy
Boy!&rsquo; And Bruno said &lsquo;Oh, if you please,
<span class="pb" id="Page_232">232</span>
Sir, <i>don&rsquo;t</i> talk about eating little boys! It
makes me so <i>shivery</i>!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The real Bruno shivered, in sympathy with
the hero.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the Lion said &lsquo;Oh, well, we won&rsquo;t talk
about it, then! I&rsquo;ll tell you what happened on
my wedding-day&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like <i>this</i> part better,&rdquo; said Bruno, patting
my cheek to keep me awake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;There was, oh, such a lovely wedding-breakfast!
At <i>one</i> end of the table there was
a large plum-pudding. And at the other end
there was a nice roasted <i>Lamb</i>! Oh, you&rsquo;ve
no <i>idea</i> what a delicious thing it is&mdash;a nice
roasted Lamb!&rsquo; And the Lamb said &lsquo;Oh,
if you please, Sir, <i>don&rsquo;t</i> talk about eating
Lambs! It makes me so <i>shivery</i>!&rsquo; And the
Lion said &lsquo;Oh, well, we won&rsquo;t talk about it,
then!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_233">233</div>
<h2 id="c15">CHAPTER XV.
<br /><span class="small">THE LITTLE FOXES.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;So, when they got to the top of the hill,
Bruno opened the hamper: and he took out
the Bread, and the Apples, and the Milk:
and they ate, and they drank. And when
they&rsquo;d finished the Milk, and eaten half the
Bread and half the Apples, the Lamb said
&lsquo;Oh, my paws is so sticky! I want to wash
my paws!&rsquo; And the Lion said &lsquo;Well, go
down the hill, and wash them in the brook,
yonder. We&rsquo;ll wait for you!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It never comed back!&rdquo; Bruno solemnly
whispered to me.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_234">234</div>
<p>But Sylvie overheard him. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not to
whisper, Bruno! It spoils the story! And
when the Lamb had been gone a long time,
the Lion said to Bruno &lsquo;Do go and see after
that silly little Lamb! It must have lost its
way.&rsquo; And Bruno went down the hill. And
when he got to the brook, he saw the Lamb
sitting on the bank: and who should be sitting
by it but an old Fox!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know who <i>should</i> be sitting by it,&rdquo;
Bruno said thoughtfully to himself. &ldquo;A old
Fox <i>were</i> sitting by it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the old Fox were saying,&rdquo; Sylvie went
on, for once conceding the grammatical point,
&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes, my dear, you&rsquo;ll be ever so happy with
us, if you&rsquo;ll only come and see us! I&rsquo;ve got
three little Foxes there, and we do love little
Lambs so dearly!&rsquo; And the Lamb said &lsquo;But
you never <i>eat</i> them, do you, Sir?&rsquo; And the
Fox said &lsquo;Oh, no! What, <i>eat</i> a Lamb? We
never <i>dream</i> of doing such a thing!&rsquo; So the
Lamb said &lsquo;Then I&rsquo;ll come with you.&rsquo; And
off they went, hand in hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That Fox were welly extremely wicked,
<i>weren&rsquo;t</i> it?&rdquo; said Bruno.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_235">235</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; said Sylvie, rather shocked at
such violent language. &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t quite so
bad as that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I mean, it wasn&rsquo;t nice,&rdquo; the little
fellow corrected himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so Bruno went back to the Lion.
&lsquo;Oh, come quick!&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;The Fox has
taken the Lamb to his house with him! I&rsquo;m
<i>sure</i> he means to eat it!&rsquo; And the Lion said
&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll come as quick as ever I can!&rsquo; And they
trotted down the hill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do oo think he caught the Fox, Mister
Sir?&rdquo; said Bruno. I shook my head, not
liking to speak: and Sylvie went on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And when they got to the house, Bruno
looked in at the window. And there he saw
the three little Foxes sitting round the table,
with their clean pinafores on, and spoons in
their hands&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Spoons in their hands!&rdquo; Bruno repeated
in an ecstasy of delight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the Fox had got a great big knife&mdash;all
ready to kill the poor little Lamb&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
(&ldquo;Oo needn&rsquo;t be flightened, Mister Sir!&rdquo;
Bruno put in, in a hasty whisper.)</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_236">236</div>
<div class="img" id="fig18">
<img src="images/i236.jpg" alt="&lsquo;ENTER THE LION&rsquo;" width="775" height="500" />
<p class="center small">&lsquo;ENTER THE LION&rsquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_237">237</div>
<p>&ldquo;And just as he was going to do it, Bruno
heard a great ROAR&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; (The real Bruno
put his hand into mine, and held tight), &ldquo;and
the Lion came <i>bang</i> through the door, and
the next moment it had bitten off the old
Fox&rsquo;s head! And Bruno jumped in at the
window, and went leaping round the room, and
crying out &lsquo;Hooray! Hooray! The old Fox
is dead! The old Fox is dead!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bruno got up in some excitement. &ldquo;May I
do it now?&rdquo; he enquired.</p>
<p>Sylvie was quite decided on this point.
&ldquo;Wait till afterwards,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;The speeches
come next, don&rsquo;t you know? You always love
the speeches, <i>don&rsquo;t</i> you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I doos,&rdquo; said Bruno: and sat down
again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Lion&rsquo;s speech. &lsquo;Now, you silly little
Lamb, go home to your mother, and never
listen to old Foxes again. And be very good
and obedient.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Lamb&rsquo;s speech. &lsquo;Oh, indeed, Sir, I
will, Sir!&rsquo; and the Lamb went away.&rdquo; (&ldquo;But
<i>oo</i> needn&rsquo;t go away!&rdquo; Bruno explained. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
quite the nicest part&mdash;what&rsquo;s coming now!&rdquo;
<span class="pb" id="Page_238">238</span>
Sylvie smiled. She liked having an appreciative
audience.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Lion&rsquo;s speech to Bruno. &lsquo;Now,
Bruno, take those little Foxes home with
you, and teach them to be good obedient
little Foxes! Not like that wicked old thing
there, that&rsquo;s got no head!&rsquo;&rdquo; (&ldquo;That hasn&rsquo;t
got no head,&rdquo; Bruno repeated.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bruno&rsquo;s speech to the Lion. &lsquo;Oh, indeed,
Sir, I will, Sir!&rsquo; And the Lion went away.&rdquo;
(&ldquo;It gets betterer and betterer, now,&rdquo; Bruno
whispered to me, &ldquo;right away to the end!&rdquo;)</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bruno&rsquo;s speech to the little Foxes. &lsquo;Now,
little Foxes, you&rsquo;re going to have your first
lesson in being good. I&rsquo;m going to put you
into the hamper, along with the Apples and the
Bread: and you&rsquo;re not to eat the Apples: and
you&rsquo;re not to eat the Bread: and you&rsquo;re not to
eat <i>anything</i>&mdash;&mdash;till we get to my house: and
then you&rsquo;ll have your supper.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The little Foxes&rsquo; speech to Bruno. The
little Foxes said nothing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So Bruno put the Apples into the hamper&mdash;and
the little Foxes&mdash;and the Bread&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
(&ldquo;They had picnicked all the Milk,&rdquo; Bruno
<span class="pb" id="Page_239">239</span>
explained in a whisper) &ldquo;&mdash;and he set off
to go to his house.&rdquo; (&ldquo;We&rsquo;re getting near
the end now,&rdquo; said Bruno.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;And, when he had got a little way, he
thought he would look into the hamper, and
see how the little Foxes were getting on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So he opened the door&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; said Bruno.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Bruno!&rdquo; Sylvie exclaimed, &ldquo;<i>you&rsquo;re</i>
not telling the story! So he opened the door,
and behold, there were no Apples! So Bruno
said &lsquo;Eldest little Fox, have <i>you</i> been eating
the Apples?&rsquo; And the eldest little Fox said
&lsquo;No no no!&rsquo;&rdquo; (It is impossible to give the
tone in which Sylvie repeated this rapid little
&lsquo;No no no!&rsquo; The nearest I can come to it
is to say that it was much as if a young and
excited duck had tried to quack the words.
It was too quick for a quack, and yet too harsh
to be anything else.) &ldquo;Then he said &lsquo;Second
little Fox, have <i>you</i> been eating the Apples?&rsquo;
And the second little Fox said &lsquo;No no no!&rsquo;
Then he said &lsquo;Youngest little Fox, have <i>you</i>
been eating the Apples?&rsquo; And the youngest
little Fox <i>tried</i> to say &lsquo;No no no!&rsquo; but its
mouth was so full, it couldn&rsquo;t, and it only
<span class="pb" id="Page_240">240</span>
said &lsquo;Wauch! Wauch! Wauch!&rsquo; And Bruno
looked into its mouth. And its mouth was
full of Apples! And Bruno shook his head,
and he said &lsquo;Oh dear, oh dear! What bad
creatures these Foxes are!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bruno was listening intently: and, when
Sylvie paused to take breath, he could only
just gasp out the words &ldquo;About the Bread?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Sylvie, &ldquo;the Bread comes next.
So he shut the door again; and he went a
little further; and then he thought he&rsquo;d just
peep in once more. And behold, there was no
Bread!&rdquo; (&ldquo;What do &lsquo;behold&rsquo; <i>mean</i>?&rdquo; said
Bruno. &ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; said Sylvie.) &ldquo;And he said
&lsquo;Eldest little Fox, have <i>you</i> been eating the
Bread?&rsquo; And the eldest little Fox said &lsquo;No
no no!&rsquo; &lsquo;Second little Fox, have <i>you</i> been
eating the Bread?&rsquo; And the second little Fox
only said &lsquo;Wauch! Wauch! Wauch!&rsquo; And
Bruno looked into its mouth, and its mouth
was full of Bread!&rdquo; (&ldquo;It might have chokeded
it,&rdquo; said Bruno.) &ldquo;So he said &lsquo;Oh dear, oh
dear! What <i>shall</i> I do with these Foxes?&rsquo;
And he went a little further.&rdquo; (&ldquo;Now comes
the most interesting part,&rdquo; Bruno whispered.)</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_241">241</div>
<p>&ldquo;And when Bruno opened the hamper again,
what do you think he saw?&rdquo; (&ldquo;Only <i>two</i>
Foxes!&rdquo; Bruno cried in a great hurry.) &ldquo;You
shouldn&rsquo;t tell it so quick. However, he <i>did</i>
see only <i>two</i> Foxes. And he said &lsquo;Eldest
little Fox, have you been eating the youngest
little Fox?&rsquo; And the eldest little Fox said
&lsquo;No no no!&rsquo; &lsquo;Second little Fox, have <i>you</i>
been eating the youngest little Fox?&rsquo; And
the second little Fox did its very best to say
&lsquo;No no no!&rsquo; but it could only say &lsquo;Weuchk!
Weuchk! Weuchk!&rsquo; And when Bruno looked
into its mouth, it was half full of Bread, and
half full of Fox!&rdquo; (Bruno said nothing in the
pause this time. He was beginning to pant a
little, as he knew the crisis was coming.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;And when he&rsquo;d got nearly home, he looked
once more into the hamper, and he saw&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Bruno began, but a generous
thought struck him, and he looked at me. &ldquo;<i>Oo</i>
may say it, <i>this</i> time, Mister Sir!&rdquo; he whispered.
It was a noble offer, but I wouldn&rsquo;t
rob him of the treat. &ldquo;Go on, Bruno,&rdquo; I said,
&ldquo;you say it much the best.&rdquo; &ldquo;Only&mdash;but&mdash;<i>one</i>&mdash;Fox!&rdquo;
Bruno said with great solemnity.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_242">242</div>
<div class="img" id="fig19">
<img src="images/i242.jpg" alt="&lsquo;WHIHUAUCH! WHIHUAUCH!&rsquo;" width="500" height="745" />
<p class="center small">&lsquo;WHIHUAUCH! WHIHUAUCH!&rsquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Eldest little Fox,&rsquo;&rdquo; Sylvie said, dropping
the narrative-form in her eagerness, &ldquo;&lsquo;you&rsquo;ve
been <i>so</i> good that I can hardly believe <i>you&rsquo;ve</i>
been disobedient: but I&rsquo;m <i>afraid</i> you&rsquo;ve been
eating your little sister?&rsquo; And the eldest little
Fox said &lsquo;Whihuauch! Whihuauch!&rsquo; and then
it choked. And Bruno looked into its mouth,
and it <i>was</i> full!&rdquo; (Sylvie paused to take
breath, and Bruno lay back among the daisies,
<span class="pb" id="Page_243">243</span>
and looked at me triumphantly. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it
<i>grand</i>, Mister Sir?&rdquo; said he. I tried hard to
assume a critical tone. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s grand,&rdquo; I said:
&ldquo;but it frightens one so!&rdquo; &ldquo;Oo may sit a
little closer to <i>me</i>, if oo like,&rdquo; said Bruno.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so Bruno went home: and took the
hamper into the kitchen, and opened it. And
he saw&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Sylvie looked at <i>me</i>, this time, as
if she thought I had been rather neglected and
ought to be allowed <i>one</i> guess, at any rate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He ca&rsquo;n&rsquo;t guess!&rdquo; Bruno cried eagerly.
&ldquo;I &rsquo;fraid I <i>must</i> tell him! There weren&rsquo;t&mdash;<i>nuffin</i>
in the hamper!&rdquo; I shivered in terror,
and Bruno clapped his hands with delight.
&ldquo;He <i>is</i> flightened, Sylvie! Tell the rest!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So Bruno said &lsquo;Eldest little Fox, have you
been eating <i>yourself</i>, you wicked little Fox?&rsquo;
And the eldest little Fox said &lsquo;Whihuauch!&rsquo;
And then Bruno saw there was only its <i>mouth</i>
in the hamper! So he took the mouth, and he
opened it, and shook, and shook! And at last
he shook the little Fox out of its own mouth!
And then he said &lsquo;Open your mouth again,
you wicked little thing!&rsquo; And he shook, and
shook! And he shook out the second little
<span class="pb" id="Page_244">244</span>
Fox! And he said &lsquo;Now open <i>your</i> mouth!&rsquo;
And he shook, and shook! And he shook out
the youngest little Fox, and all the Apples, and
all the Bread!</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then Bruno stood the little Foxes up
against the wall: and he made them a little
speech. &lsquo;Now, little Foxes, you&rsquo;ve begun very
wickedly&mdash;and you&rsquo;ll have to be punished.
First you&rsquo;ll go up to the nursery, and wash
your faces, and put on clean pinafores. Then
you&rsquo;ll hear the bell ring for supper. Then you&rsquo;ll
come down: and <i>you won&rsquo;t have any supper</i>:
but you&rsquo;ll have a good <i>whipping</i>! Then you&rsquo;ll
go to bed. Then in the morning you&rsquo;ll hear
the bell ring for breakfast. <i>But you won&rsquo;t have
any breakfast!</i> You&rsquo;ll have a good <i>whipping</i>!
Then you&rsquo;ll have your lessons. And, perhaps,
if you&rsquo;re <i>very</i> good, when dinner-time comes,
you&rsquo;ll have a little dinner, and no more
whipping!&rsquo;&rdquo; (&ldquo;How <i>very</i> kind he was!&rdquo; I
whispered to Bruno. &ldquo;<i>Middling</i> kind,&rdquo; Bruno
corrected me gravely.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;So the little Foxes ran up to the nursery.
And soon Bruno went into the hall, and rang
the big bell. &lsquo;Tingle, tingle, tingle! Supper,
<span class="pb" id="Page_245">245</span>
supper, supper!&rsquo; Down came the little Foxes,
in such a hurry for their supper! Clean pinafores!
Spoons in their hands! And, when they
got into the dining-room, there was ever such
a white table-cloth on the table! But there was
nothing on it but a big whip. And they had
<i>such</i> a whipping!&rdquo; (I put my handkerchief to
my eyes, and Bruno hastily climbed upon my
knee and stroked my face. &ldquo;Only <i>one</i> more
whipping, Mister Sir!&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
cry more than oo ca&rsquo;n&rsquo;t help!&rdquo;)</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the next morning early, Bruno rang
the big bell again. &lsquo;Tingle, tingle, tingle!
Breakfast, breakfast, breakfast!&rsquo; Down came
the little Foxes! Clean pinafores! Spoons in
their hands! No breakfast! Only the big
whip! Then came lessons,&rdquo; Sylvie hurried on,
for I still had my handkerchief to my eyes.
&ldquo;And the little Foxes were ever so good!
And they learned their lessons backwards,
and forwards, and upside-down. And at last
Bruno rang the big bell again. &lsquo;Tingle, tingle,
tingle! Dinner, dinner, dinner!&rsquo; And when
the little Foxes came down&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; (&ldquo;Had they
clean pinafores on?&rdquo; Bruno enquired. &ldquo;Of
<span class="pb" id="Page_246">246</span>
course!&rdquo; said Sylvie. &ldquo;And spoons?&rdquo; &ldquo;Why,
you <i>know</i> they had!&rdquo; &ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t be <i>certain</i>,&rdquo;
said Bruno.) &ldquo;&mdash;they came as slow as slow!
And they said &lsquo;Oh! There&rsquo;ll be no dinner!
There&rsquo;ll only be the big whip!&rsquo; But, when
they got into the room, they saw the most
<i>lovely</i> dinner!&rdquo; (&ldquo;Buns?&rdquo; cried Bruno, clapping
his hands.) &ldquo;Buns, and cake, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
(&ldquo;&mdash;and jam?&rdquo; said Bruno.) &ldquo;Yes, jam&mdash;and
soup&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; (&ldquo;&mdash;and <i>sugar plums</i>!&rdquo;
Bruno put in once more; and Sylvie seemed
satisfied.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;And ever after that, they <i>were</i> such good
little Foxes! They did their lessons as good
as gold&mdash;and they never did what Bruno told
them not to&mdash;and they never ate each other
any more&mdash;and <i>they never ate themselves</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The story came to an end so suddenly,
it almost took my breath away; however I did
my best to make a pretty speech of thanks.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s very&mdash;very&mdash;very much so,
I&rsquo;m sure!&rdquo; I seemed to hear myself say.</p>

<h2 id="c16">CHAPTER XVI.
<br /><span class="small">BEYOND THESE VOICES.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t quite catch what you said!&rdquo; were
the next words that reached my ear, but certainly
<i>not</i> in the voice either of Sylvie or of
Bruno, whom I could just see, through the
crowd of guests, standing by the piano, and
listening to the Count&rsquo;s song. Mein Herr was
the speaker. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t quite catch what you
said!&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ve no doubt you
take <i>my</i> view of it. Thank you <i>very</i> much for
your kind attention. There is only but <i>one</i>
verse left to be sung!&rdquo; These last words were
not in the gentle voice of Mein Herr, but in
<span class="pb" id="Page_248">248</span>
the deep bass of the French Count. And, in
the silence that followed, the final stanza of
&lsquo;Tottles&rsquo; rang through the room.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig20">
<img src="images/i248.jpg" alt="&lsquo;NEVER!&rsquo; YELLED TOTTLES" width="500" height="382" />
<p class="center small">&lsquo;NEVER!&rsquo; YELLED TOTTLES</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">See now this couple settled down</p>
<p class="t0">In quiet lodgings, out of town:</p>
<p class="t0">Submissively the tearful wife</p>
<p class="t0">Accepts a plain and humble life:</p>
<p class="t0">Yet begs one boon on bended knee:</p>
<p class="t0">&lsquo;My ducky-darling, don&rsquo;t resent it!</p>
<p class="t0">Mamma might come for two or three&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="t0">&lsquo;NEVER!&rsquo; yelled Tottles. And he meant it.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_249">249</div>
<p>The conclusion of the song was followed by
quite a chorus of thanks and compliments from
all parts of the room, which the gratified singer
responded to by bowing low in all directions.
&ldquo;It is to me a great privilege,&rdquo; he said to Lady
Muriel, &ldquo;to have met with this so marvellous a
song. The accompaniment to him is so strange,
so mysterious: it is as if a new music were to
be invented! I will play him once again so as
that to show you what I mean.&rdquo; He returned
to the piano, but the song had vanished.</p>
<p>The bewildered singer searched through the
heap of music lying on an adjoining table, but
it was not there, either. Lady Muriel helped
in the search: others soon joined: the excitement
grew. &ldquo;What <i>can</i> have become of it?&rdquo;
exclaimed Lady Muriel. Nobody knew: one
thing only was certain, that no one had been
near the piano since the Count had sung the
last verse of the song.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nevare mind him!&rdquo; he said, most good-naturedly.
&ldquo;I shall give it you with memory
alone!&rdquo; He sat down, and began vaguely fingering
the notes; but nothing resembling the
tune came out. Then he, too, grew excited.
<span class="pb" id="Page_250">250</span>
&ldquo;But what oddness! How much of singularity!
That I might lose, not the words alone, but the
tune also&mdash;that is quite curious, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>We all supposed it, heartily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was that sweet little boy, who found it
for me,&rdquo; the Count suggested. &ldquo;Quite perhaps
<i>he</i> is the thief?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course he is!&rdquo; cried Lady Muriel.
&ldquo;Bruno! Where are you, my darling?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But no Bruno replied: it seemed that the
two children had vanished as suddenly, and as
mysteriously, as the song.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are playing us a trick!&rdquo; Lady Muriel
gaily exclaimed. &ldquo;This is only an <i>ex tempore</i>
game of Hide-and-Seek! That little Bruno is
an embodied Mischief!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The suggestion was a welcome one to most
of us, for some of the guests were beginning
to look decidedly uneasy. A general search was
set on foot with much enthusiasm: curtains were
thrown back and shaken, cupboards opened, and
ottomans turned over; but the number of possible
hiding-places proved to be strictly limited;
and the search came to an end almost as soon
as it had begun.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_251">251</div>
<p>&ldquo;They must have run out, while we were
wrapped up in the song,&rdquo; Lady Muriel said,
addressing herself to the Count, who seemed
more agitated than the others; &ldquo;and no doubt
they&rsquo;ve found their way back to the housekeeper&rsquo;s
room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not by <i>this</i> door!&rdquo; was the earnest protest
of a knot of two or three gentlemen, who had
been grouped round the door (one of them
actually leaning against it) for the last half-hour,
as they declared. &ldquo;<i>This</i> door has not
been opened since the song began!&rdquo;</p>
<p>An uncomfortable silence followed this announcement.
Lady Muriel ventured no further
conjectures, but quietly examined the fastenings
of the windows, which opened as doors. They
all proved to be well fastened, <i>inside</i>.</p>
<p>Not yet at the end of her resources, Lady
Muriel rang the bell. &ldquo;Ask the housekeeper
to step here,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and to bring the
children&rsquo;s walking-things with her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve brought them, my Lady,&rdquo; said the
obsequious housekeeper, entering after another
minute of silence. &ldquo;I thought the young
lady would have come to my room to put on
<span class="pb" id="Page_252">252</span>
her boots. Here&rsquo;s your boots, my love!&rdquo; she
added cheerfully, looking in all directions for
the children. There was no answer, and she
turned to Lady Muriel with a puzzled smile.
&ldquo;Have the little darlings hid themselves?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see them, just now,&rdquo; Lady Muriel
replied, rather evasively. &ldquo;You can leave their
things here, Wilson. <i>I&rsquo;ll</i> dress them, when
they&rsquo;re ready to go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two little hats, and Sylvie&rsquo;s walking-jacket,
were handed round among the ladies,
with many exclamations of delight. There
certainly was a sort of witchery of beauty about
them. Even the little boots did not miss their
share of favorable criticism. &ldquo;Such natty little
things!&rdquo; the musical young lady exclaimed,
almost fondling them as she spoke. &ldquo;And
what tiny tiny feet they must have!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Finally, the things were piled together on the
centre-ottoman, and the guests, despairing of
seeing the children again, began to wish good-night
and leave the house.</p>
<p>There were only some eight or nine left&mdash;to
whom the Count was explaining, for the
twentieth time, how he had had his eye on the
<span class="pb" id="Page_253">253</span>
children during the last verse of the song; how
he had then glanced round the room, to see
what effect &ldquo;de great chest-note&rdquo; had had
upon his audience; and how, when he looked
back again, they had both disappeared&mdash;when
exclamations of dismay began to be heard
on all sides, the Count hastily bringing his
story to an end to join in the outcry.</p>
<p>The walking-things had all disappeared!</p>
<p>After the utter failure of the search for the
<i>children</i>, there was a very half-hearted search
made for their <i>apparel</i>. The remaining guests
seemed only too glad to get away, leaving only
the Count and our four selves.</p>
<p>The Count sank into an easy-chair, and
panted a little.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who then <i>are</i> these dear children, I pray
you?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Why come they, why go
they, in this so little ordinary a fashion? That
the music should make itself to vanish&mdash;that
the hats, the boots, should make themselves to
vanish&mdash;how is it, I pray you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no idea where they are!&rdquo; was all I
could say, on finding myself appealed to, by
general consent, for an explanation.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_254">254</div>
<p>The Count seemed about to ask further
questions, but checked himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The hour makes himself to become late,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;I wish to you a very good night,
my Lady. I betake myself to my bed&mdash;to
dream&mdash;if that indeed I be not dreaming
now!&rdquo; And he hastily left the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stay awhile, stay awhile!&rdquo; said the Earl,
as I was about to follow the Count. &ldquo;<i>You</i>
are not a guest, you know! Arthur&rsquo;s friend
is at <i>home</i> here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks!&rdquo; I said, as, with true English
instincts, we drew our chairs together round
the fire-place, though no fire was burning&mdash;Lady
Muriel having taken the heap of music
on her knee, to have one more search for the
strangely-vanished song.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you sometimes feel a wild longing,&rdquo;
she said, addressing herself to me, &ldquo;to have
something more to do with your hands, while
you talk, than just holding a cigar, and now
and then knocking off the ash? Oh, I know
all that you&rsquo;re going to say!&rdquo; (This was to
Arthur, who appeared about to interrupt her.)
&ldquo;The Majesty of Thought supersedes the
<span class="pb" id="Page_255">255</span>
work of the fingers. A Man&rsquo;s severe thinking,
<i>plus</i> the shaking-off a cigar-ash, comes to the
same total as a Woman&rsquo;s trivial fancies, <i>plus</i>
the most elaborate embroidery. <i>That&rsquo;s</i> your
sentiment, isn&rsquo;t it, only better expressed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Arthur looked into the radiant, mischievous
face, with a grave and very tender smile.
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said resignedly: &ldquo;that is my sentiment,
exactly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rest of body, and activity of mind,&rdquo; I put
in. &ldquo;Some writer tells us <i>that</i> is the acme of
human happiness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Plenty of <i>bodily</i> rest, at any rate!&rdquo; Lady
Muriel replied, glancing at the three recumbent
figures around her. &ldquo;But what you call
activity of <i>mind</i>&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&mdash;is the privilege of young Physicians
<i>only</i>,&rdquo; said the Earl. &ldquo;We old men have no
claim to be active! <i>What can an old man
do but die?</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A good many other things, I should <i>hope</i>,&rdquo;
Arthur said earnestly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, maybe. Still you have the advantage
of me in many ways, dear boy! Not
only that <i>your</i> day is dawning while <i>mine</i> is
<span class="pb" id="Page_256">256</span>
setting, but your <i>interest</i> in Life&mdash;somehow I
ca&rsquo;n&rsquo;t help envying you <i>that</i>. It will be many
a year before you lose your hold of <i>that</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet surely many human interests <i>survive</i>
human Life?&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Many do, no doubt. And <i>some</i> forms of
Science; but only <i>some</i>, I think. Mathematics,
for instance: <i>that</i> seems to possess an endless
interest: one ca&rsquo;n&rsquo;t imagine <i>any</i> form of Life,
or <i>any</i> race of intelligent beings, where Mathematical
truth would lose its meaning. But I
fear <i>Medicine</i> stands on a different footing.
Suppose you discover a remedy for some disease
hitherto supposed to be incurable. Well,
it is delightful for the moment, no doubt&mdash;full
of interest&mdash;perhaps it brings you fame and
fortune. But what then? Look on, a few
years, into a life where disease has no existence.
What is your discovery worth, <i>then</i>?
Milton makes Jove promise too much. &lsquo;<i>Of
so much fame in heaven expect thy meed.</i>&rsquo; Poor
comfort, when one&rsquo;s &lsquo;fame&rsquo; concerns matters
that will have ceased to have a meaning!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At any rate, one wouldn&rsquo;t care to make
any <i>fresh</i> medical discoveries,&rdquo; said Arthur.
<span class="pb" id="Page_257">257</span>
&ldquo;I see no help for <i>that</i>&mdash;though I shall be
sorry to give up my favorite studies. Still,
medicine, disease, pain, sorrow, sin&mdash;I fear
they&rsquo;re all linked together. Banish sin, and
you banish them all!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Military</i> science is a yet stronger instance,&rdquo;
said the Earl. &ldquo;Without sin, <i>war</i> would surely
be impossible. Still any mind, that has had in
this life any keen interest, not in <i>itself</i> sinful,
will surely find itself <i>some</i> congenial line of
work hereafter. Wellington may have no more
<i>battles</i> to fight&mdash;and yet&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&lsquo;We doubt not that, for one so true,</p>
<p class="t0">There must be other, nobler work to do,</p>
<p class="t0">Than when he fought at Waterloo,</p>
<p class="t3">And Victor he must ever be!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>He lingered over the beautiful words, as if
he loved them: and his voice, like distant
music, died away into silence.</p>
<p>After a minute or two he began again. &ldquo;If
I&rsquo;m not wearying you, I would like to tell you
an idea of the future Life which has haunted
me for years, like a sort of waking nightmare&mdash;I
ca&rsquo;n&rsquo;t reason myself out of it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_258">258</div>
<p>&ldquo;Pray do,&rdquo; Arthur and I replied, almost in
a breath. Lady Muriel put aside the heap
of music, and folded her hands together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The one idea,&rdquo; the Earl resumed, &ldquo;that
has seemed to me to overshadow all the rest,
is that of <i>Eternity</i>&mdash;involving, as it seems to
do, the necessary <i>exhaustion</i> of all subjects of
human interest. Take Pure Mathematics, for
instance&mdash;a Science independent of our present
surroundings. I have studied it, myself,
a little. Take the subject of circles and ellipses&mdash;what
we call &lsquo;curves of the second degree.&rsquo;
In a future Life, it would only be a
question of so many years (or <i>hundreds</i> of
years, if you like), for a man to work out <i>all</i>
their properties. Then he <i>might</i> go to curves
of the third degree. Say <i>that</i> took ten times
as long (you see we have <i>unlimited</i> time to
deal with). I can hardly imagine his <i>interest</i>
in the subject holding out even for those; and,
though there is no limit to the <i>degree</i> of the
curves he might study, yet surely the time,
needed to exhaust <i>all</i> the novelty and interest
of the subject, would be absolutely <i>finite</i>?
And so of all other branches of Science. And,
<span class="pb" id="Page_259">259</span>
when I transport myself, in thought, through
some thousands or millions of years, and fancy
myself possessed of as much Science as one
created reason can carry, I ask myself &lsquo;What
then? With nothing more to learn, can one
rest content on <i>knowledge</i>, for the eternity yet
to be lived through?&rsquo; It has been a very
wearying thought to me. I have sometimes
fancied one <i>might</i>, in that event, say &lsquo;It is
better <i>not</i> to be,&rsquo; and pray for personal <i>annihilation</i>&mdash;the
Nirvana of the Buddhists.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that is only half the picture,&rdquo; I said.
&ldquo;Besides working for <i>oneself</i>, may there not
be the helping of <i>others</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely, surely!&rdquo; Lady Muriel exclaimed
in a tone of relief, looking at her father with
sparkling eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the Earl, &ldquo;so long as there <i>were</i>
any others needing help. But, given ages and
ages more, surely all created reasons would at
length reach the same dead level of <i>satiety</i>.
And <i>then</i> what is there to look forward to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know that weary feeling,&rdquo; said the young
Doctor. &ldquo;I have gone through it all, more
than once. Now let me tell you how I have
<span class="pb" id="Page_260">260</span>
put it to myself. I have imagined a little child,
playing with toys on his nursery-floor, and yet
able to <i>reason</i>, and to look on, thirty years
ahead. Might he not say to himself &lsquo;By that
time I shall have had enough of bricks and
ninepins. How weary Life will be!&rsquo; Yet, if
we look forward through those thirty years, we
find him a great statesman, full of interests and
joys far more intense than his baby-life could
give&mdash;joys wholly inconceivable to his baby-mind&mdash;joys
such as no baby-language could in
the faintest degree describe. Now, may not our
life, a million years hence, have the same relation,
to our life now, that the man&rsquo;s life has to
the child&rsquo;s? And, just as one might try, all in
vain, to express to that child, in the language
of bricks and ninepins, the meaning of &lsquo;politics,&rsquo;
so perhaps all those descriptions of Heaven,
with its music, and its feasts, and its streets of
gold, may be only attempts to describe, in <i>our</i>
words, things for which we <i>really</i> have no
words at all. Don&rsquo;t you think that, in <i>your</i>
picture of another life, you are in fact transplanting
that child into political life, without
making any allowance for his growing up?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_261">261</div>
<p>&ldquo;I think I understand you,&rdquo; said the Earl.
&ldquo;The music of Heaven <i>may</i> be something
beyond our powers of thought. Yet the music
of Earth is sweet! Muriel, my child, sing us
something before we go to bed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do,&rdquo; said Arthur, as he rose and lit the
candles on the cottage-piano, lately banished
from the drawing-room to make room for a
&lsquo;semi-grand.&rsquo; &ldquo;There is a song here, that I
have never heard you sing.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&lsquo;Hail to thee, blithe spirit!</p>
<p class="t">Bird thou never wert,</p>
<p class="t0">That from Heaven, or near it,</p>
<p class="t">Pourest thy full heart!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>he read from the page he had spread open
before her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And our little life here,&rdquo; the Earl went on,
&ldquo;is, to that grand time, like a child&rsquo;s summer-day!
One gets tired as night draws on,&rdquo; he
added, with a touch of sadness in his voice,
&ldquo;and one gets to long for bed! For those
welcome words &lsquo;Come, child, &rsquo;tis bed-time!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_262">262</div>
<h2 id="c17">CHAPTER XVII.
<br /><span class="small">TO THE RESCUE!</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;It <i>isn&rsquo;t</i> bed-time!&rdquo; said a sleepy little
voice. &ldquo;The owls hasn&rsquo;t gone to bed, and I
s&rsquo;a&rsquo;n&rsquo;t go to seep wizout oo sings to me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Bruno!&rdquo; cried Sylvie. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you
know the owls have only just got up? But
the <i>frogs</i> have gone to bed, ages ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, <i>I</i> aren&rsquo;t a frog,&rdquo; said Bruno.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What shall I sing?&rdquo; said Sylvie, skilfully
avoiding the argument.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ask Mister Sir,&rdquo; Bruno lazily replied, clasping
his hands behind his curly head, and lying
back on his fern-leaf, till it almost bent over
<span class="pb" id="Page_263">263</span>
with his weight. &ldquo;This aren&rsquo;t a comfable leaf,
Sylvie. Find me a comfabler&mdash;please!&rdquo; he
added, as an after-thought, in obedience to a
warning finger held up by Sylvie. &ldquo;I doosn&rsquo;t
like being feet-upwards!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a pretty sight to see&mdash;the motherly
way in which the fairy-child gathered up her
little brother in her arms, and laid him on a
stronger leaf. She gave it just a touch to set
it rocking, and it went on vigorously by itself,
as if it contained some hidden machinery. It
certainly wasn&rsquo;t the wind, for the evening-breeze
had quite died away again, and not a leaf was
stirring over our heads.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why does that one leaf rock so, without
the others?&rdquo; I asked Sylvie. She only smiled
sweetly and shook her head. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know
<i>why</i>,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It always does, if it&rsquo;s got a
fairy-child on it. It <i>has</i> to, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And can people see the leaf rock, who ca&rsquo;n&rsquo;t
see the Fairy on it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, of course!&rdquo; cried Sylvie. &ldquo;A leaf&rsquo;s
a leaf, and everybody can see it; but Bruno&rsquo;s
Bruno, and they ca&rsquo;n&rsquo;t see <i>him</i>, unless they&rsquo;re
eerie, like you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_264">264</div>
<p>Then I understood how it was that one
sometimes sees&mdash;going through the woods in
a still evening&mdash;one fern-leaf rocking steadily
on, all by itself. Haven&rsquo;t you ever seen that?
Try if you can see the fairy-sleeper on it, next
time; but don&rsquo;t <i>pick</i> the leaf, whatever you do;
let the little one sleep on!</p>
<p>But all this time Bruno was getting sleepier
and sleepier. &ldquo;Sing, sing!&rdquo; he murmured fretfully.
Sylvie looked to me for instructions.
&ldquo;What shall it be?&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could you sing him the nursery-song you
once told me of?&rdquo; I suggested. &ldquo;The one
that had been put through the mind-mangle,
you know. &lsquo;<i>The little man that had a little
gun</i>,&rsquo; I think it was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, that are one of the <i>Professor&rsquo;s</i>
songs!&rdquo; cried Bruno. &ldquo;I likes the little man;
and I likes the way they spinned him&mdash;&mdash;like a
teetle-totle-tum.&rdquo; And he turned a loving look
on the gentle old man who was sitting at the
other side of his leaf-bed, and who instantly
began to sing, accompanying himself on his
Outlandish guitar, while the snail, on which he
sat, waved its horns in time to the music.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s sound asleep now,&rdquo; said Sylvie, carefully
tucking in the edge of a violet-leaf, which
she had been spreading over him as a sort of
blanket: &ldquo;good night!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good night!&rdquo; I echoed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may well say &lsquo;good night&rsquo;!&rdquo; laughed
Lady Muriel, rising and shutting up the piano
as she spoke. &ldquo;When you&rsquo;ve been nid&mdash;nid&mdash;nodding
all the time I&rsquo;ve been singing for

she demanded imperiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something about a duck?&rdquo; I hazarded.
&ldquo;Well, a bird of some kind?&rdquo; I corrected
myself, perceiving at once that <i>that</i> guess was
wrong, at any rate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Something about a bird of some kind!</i>&rdquo;
Lady Muriel repeated, with as much withering
scorn as her sweet face was capable of conveying.
&ldquo;And that&rsquo;s the way he speaks of
Shelley&rsquo;s Sky-Lark, is it? When the Poet
particularly says &lsquo;<i>Hail to thee, blithe spirit!</i>
Bird <i>thou never wert</i>!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

</div>
<p>She led the way to the smoking-room, where,
ignoring all the usages of Society and all the
instincts of Chivalry, the three Lords of the
Creation reposed at their ease in low rocking-chairs,
and permitted the one lady who was
present to glide gracefully about among us,
supplying our wants in the form of cooling
drinks, cigarettes, and lights. Nay, it was only
<i>one</i> of the three who had the chivalry to go
<span class="pb" id="Page_272">272</span>
beyond the common-place &ldquo;thank you,&rdquo; and to
quote the Poet&rsquo;s exquisite description of how
Geraint, when waited on by Enid, was moved</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;To stoop and kiss the tender little thumb</p>
<p class="t0">That crossed the platter as she laid it down,&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>and to suit the action to the word&mdash;an audacious
liberty for which, I feel bound to report,
he was <i>not</i> duly reprimanded.</p>
<p>As no topic of conversation seemed to occur
to any one, and as we were, all four, on those
delightful terms with one another (the only
terms, I think, on which any friendship, that
deserves the name of <i>intimacy</i>, can be maintained)
which involve no sort of necessity for
<i>speaking</i> for mere speaking&rsquo;s sake, we sat in
silence for some minutes.</p>
<p>At length I broke the silence by asking &ldquo;Is
there any fresh news from the harbour about
the Fever?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None since this morning,&rdquo; the Earl said,
looking very grave. &ldquo;But that was alarming
enough. The Fever is spreading fast: the
London doctor has taken fright and left the
place, and the only one now available isn&rsquo;t a
<span class="pb" id="Page_273">273</span>
regular doctor at all: he is apothecary, and
doctor, and dentist, and I don&rsquo;t know what
other trades, all in one. It&rsquo;s a bad outlook
for those poor fishermen&mdash;and a worse one
for all the women and children.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How many are there of them altogether?&rdquo;
Arthur asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There were nearly one hundred, a week
ago.&rdquo; said the Earl: &ldquo;but there have been
twenty or thirty deaths since then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what religious ministrations are there
to be had?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are three brave men down there,&rdquo;
the Earl replied, his voice trembling with emotion,
&ldquo;gallant heroes as ever won the Victoria
Cross! I am certain that no one of the three
will ever leave the place merely to save his
own life. There&rsquo;s the Curate: his wife is with
him: they have no children. Then there&rsquo;s the
Roman Catholic Priest. And there&rsquo;s the Wesleyan
Minister. They go amongst their own
flocks, mostly; but I&rsquo;m told that those who
are dying like to have <i>any</i> of the three with
them. How slight the barriers seem to be
that part Christian from Christian, when one
<span class="pb" id="Page_274">274</span>
has to deal with the great facts of Life and the
reality of Death!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So it must be, and so it should be&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
Arthur was beginning, when the front-door
bell rang, suddenly and violently.</p>
<p>We heard the front-door hastily opened, and
voices outside: then a knock at the door of
the smoking-room, and the old house-keeper
appeared, looking a little scared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two persons, my Lord, to speak with Dr.
Forester.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Arthur stepped outside at once, and we heard
his cheery &ldquo;Well, my men?&rdquo; but the answer
was less audible, the only words I could distinctly
catch being &ldquo;ten since morning, and two
more just&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But there <i>is</i> a doctor there?&rdquo; we heard
Arthur say: and a deep voice, that we had not
heard before, replied &ldquo;Dead, Sir. Died three
hours ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lady Muriel shuddered, and hid her face in
her hands: but at this moment the front-door
was quietly closed, and we heard no more.</p>
<p>For a few minutes we sat quite silent: then
the Earl left the room, and soon returned to
<span class="pb" id="Page_275">275</span>
tell us that Arthur had gone away with the
two fishermen, leaving word that he would
be back in about an hour. And, true enough,
at the end of that interval&mdash;during which
very little was said, none of us seeming to
have the heart to talk&mdash;the front-door once
more creaked on its rusty hinges, and a step
was heard in the passage, hardly to be recognised
as Arthur&rsquo;s, so slow and uncertain was
it, like a blind man feeling his way.</p>
<p>He came in, and stood before Lady Muriel,
resting one hand heavily on the table, and
with a strange look in his eyes, as if he were
walking in his sleep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Muriel&mdash;my love&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; he paused, and his
lips quivered: but after a minute he went on
more steadily. &ldquo;Muriel&mdash;my darling&mdash;they&mdash;<i>want</i>
me&mdash;down in the harbour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Must</i> you go?&rdquo; she pleaded, rising and
laying her hands on his shoulders, and looking
up into his face with her great eyes brimming
over with tears. &ldquo;Must <i>you</i> go, Arthur? It
may mean&mdash;death!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He met her gaze without flinching. &ldquo;It
<i>does</i> mean death,&rdquo; he said, in a husky whisper:
<span class="pb" id="Page_276">276</span>
&ldquo;but&mdash;darling&mdash;I am <i>called</i>. And even my
life itself&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; His voice failed him, and he
said no more.</p>
<p>For a minute she stood quite silent, looking
upwards with a helpless gaze, as if even prayer
were now useless, while her features worked
and quivered with the great agony she was
enduring. Then a sudden inspiration seemed
to come upon her and light up her face with
a strange sweet smile. &ldquo;<i>Your</i> life?&rdquo; she repeated.
&ldquo;It is not <i>yours</i> to give!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Arthur had recovered himself by this time,
and could reply quite firmly, &ldquo;That is true,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;It is not <i>mine</i> to give. It is <i>yours</i>, now,
my&mdash;wife that is to be! And you&mdash;do <i>you</i>
forbid me to go? Will you not spare me, my
own beloved one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Still clinging to him, she laid her head softly
on his breast. She had never done such a
thing in my presence before, and I knew how
deeply she must be moved. &ldquo;I <i>will</i> spare you,&rdquo;
she said, calmly and quietly, &ldquo;to God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And to God&rsquo;s poor,&rdquo; he whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And to God&rsquo;s poor,&rdquo; she added. &ldquo;When
must it be, sweet love?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_277">277</div>
<div class="img" id="fig26">
<img src="images/i277.jpg" alt="&lsquo;WILL YOU NOT SPARE ME?&rsquo;" width="400" height="643" />
<p class="center small">&lsquo;WILL YOU NOT SPARE ME?&rsquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;To-morrow morning,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;And I
have much to do before then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then he told us how he had spent his
hour of absence. He had been to the Vicarage,
and had arranged for the wedding to take place
at eight the next morning (there was no legal
obstacle, as he had, some time before this,
obtained a Special License) in the little church
<span class="pb" id="Page_278">278</span>
we knew so well. &ldquo;My old friend here,&rdquo;
indicating me, &ldquo;will act as &lsquo;Best Man,&rsquo; I know:
your father will be there to give you away:
and&mdash;and&mdash;you will dispense with bride&rsquo;s-maids,
my darling?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She nodded: no words came.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then I can go with a willing heart&mdash;to
do God&rsquo;s work&mdash;knowing that we are <i>one</i>&mdash;and
that we are together in <i>spirit</i>, though
not in bodily presence&mdash;and are most of all
together when we pray! Our <i>prayers</i> will go
up together&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes!&rdquo; sobbed Lady Muriel. &ldquo;But
you must not stay longer now, my darling!
Go home and take some rest. You will need
all your strength to-morrow&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I will go,&rdquo; said Arthur. &ldquo;We will
be here in good time to-morrow. Good night,
my own own darling!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I followed his example, and we two left the
house together. As we walked back to our
lodgings, Arthur sighed deeply once or twice,
and seemed about to speak&mdash;but no words
came, till we had entered the house, and had
lit our candles, and were at our bedroom-doors.
<span class="pb" id="Page_279">279</span>
Then Arthur said &ldquo;Good night, old
fellow! God bless you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God bless you!&rdquo; I echoed, from the very
depths of my heart.</p>
<p>We were back again at the Hall by eight in
the morning, and found Lady Muriel and the
Earl, and the old Vicar, waiting for us. It was
a strangely sad and silent party that walked up
to the little church and back; and I could not
help feeling that it was much more like a funeral
than a wedding: to Lady Muriel it <i>was</i> in fact, a
funeral rather than a wedding, so heavily did
the presentiment weigh upon her (as she told
us afterwards) that her newly-won husband was
going forth to his death.</p>
<p>Then we had breakfast; and, all too soon,
the vehicle was at the door, which was to convey
Arthur, first to his lodgings, to pick up the
things he was taking with him, and then as
far towards the death-stricken hamlet as it was
considered safe to go. One or two of the
fishermen were to meet him on the road, to
carry his things the rest of the way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And are you quite sure you are taking all
that you will need?&rdquo; Lady Muriel asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_280">280</div>
<p>&ldquo;All that I shall need as a <i>doctor</i>, certainly.
And my own personal needs are few: I shall
not even take any of my own wardrobe&mdash;there
is a fisherman&rsquo;s suit, ready-made, that
is waiting for me at my lodgings. I shall
only take my watch, and a few books, and&mdash;stay&mdash;there
<i>is</i> one book I should like to add,
a pocket-Testament&mdash;to use at the bedsides
of the sick and dying&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take mine!&rdquo; said Lady Muriel: and she
ran upstairs to fetch it. &ldquo;It has nothing
written in it but &lsquo;Muriel,&rsquo;&rdquo; she said as she
returned with it: &ldquo;shall I inscribe&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, my own one,&rdquo; said Arthur, taking it
from her. &ldquo;What <i>could</i> you inscribe better
than that? Could any human name mark it
more clearly as my own individual property?
Are <i>you</i> not mine? Are you not,&rdquo; (with all
the old playfulness of manner) &ldquo;as Bruno
would say, &lsquo;my <i>very mine</i>&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He bade a long and loving adieu to the
Earl and to me, and left the room, accompanied
only by his wife, who was bearing up bravely,
and was&mdash;<i>outwardly</i>, at least&mdash;less overcome
than her old father. We waited in the room a
<span class="pb" id="Page_281">281</span>
minute or two, till the sound of wheels had told
us that Arthur had driven away; and even
then we waited still, for the step of Lady
Muriel, going upstairs to her room, to die away
in the distance. Her step, usually so light
and joyous, now sounded slow and weary, like
one who plods on under a load of hopeless
misery; and I felt almost as hopeless, and
almost as wretched, as she. &ldquo;Are we four
destined <i>ever</i> to meet again, on this side the
grave?&rdquo; I asked myself, as I walked to my
home. And the tolling of a distant bell seemed
to answer me, &ldquo;No! No! No!&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="c18">CHAPTER XVIII.
<br /><span class="small">A NEWSPAPER-CUTTING.</span></h2>
<p class="center"><i>EXTRACT FROM THE &ldquo;FAYFIELD CHRONICLE.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p><i>Our readers will have followed with painful
interest, the accounts we have from time to time
published of the terrible epidemic which has,
during the last two months, carried off most of
the inhabitants of the little fishing-harbour adjoining
the village of Elveston. The last survivors,
numbering twenty-three only, out of a
population which, three short months ago, exceeded
one hundred and twenty, were removed
on Wednesday last, under the authority of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_283">283</span>
Local Board, and safely lodged in the County
Hospital: and the place is now veritably &lsquo;a city
of the dead,&rsquo; without a single human voice to
break its silence.</i></p>
<p><i>The rescuing party consisted of six sturdy
fellows&mdash;fishermen from the neighbourhood&mdash;directed
by the resident Physician of the Hospital,
who came over for that purpose, heading a
train of hospital-ambulances. The six men had
been selected&mdash;from a much larger number who
had volunteered for this peaceful &lsquo;forlorn hope&rsquo;&mdash;for
their strength and robust health, as the
expedition was considered to be, even now, when
the malady has expended its chief force, not
unattended with danger.</i></p>
<p><i>Every precaution that science could suggest,
against the risk of infection, was adopted: and
the sufferers were tenderly carried on litters,
one by one, up the steep hill, and placed in the
ambulances which, each provided with a hospital
nurse, were waiting on the level road. The
fifteen miles, to the Hospital, were done at a
walking-pace, as some of the patients were in too
prostrate a condition to bear jolting, and the
journey occupied the whole afternoon.</i></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_284">284</div>
<p><i>The twenty-three patients consist of nine men,
six women, and eight children. It has not been
found possible to identify them all, as some of
the children&mdash;left with no surviving relatives&mdash;are
infants; and two men and one woman
are not yet able to make rational replies, the
brain-powers being entirely in abeyance. Among
a more well-to-do-race, there would no doubt
have been names marked on the clothes; but
here no such evidence is forthcoming.</i></p>
<p><i>Besides the poor fishermen and their families,
there were but five persons to be accounted for:
and it was ascertained, beyond a doubt, that all
five are numbered with the dead. It is a melancholy
pleasure to place on record the names of
these genuine martyrs&mdash;than whom none, surely,
are more worthy to be entered on the glory-roll
of England&rsquo;s heroes! They are as follows:&mdash;</i></p>
<p><i>The Rev. James Burgess, M.A., and Emma
his wife. He was the Curate at the Harbour,
not thirty years old, and had been married only
two years. A written record was found in
their house, of the dates of their deaths.</i></p>
<p><i>Next to theirs we will place the honoured
name of Dr. Arthur Forester, who, on the death
<span class="pb" id="Page_285">285</span>
of the local physician, nobly faced the imminent
peril of death, rather than leave these poor folk
uncared for in their last extremity. No record
of his name, or of the date of his death, was
found: but the corpse was easily identified,
although dressed in the ordinary fisherman&rsquo;s
suit (which he was known to have adopted when
he went down there), by a copy of the New
Testament, the gift of his wife, which was
found, placed next his heart, with his hands
crossed over it. It was not thought prudent to
remove the body, for burial elsewhere: and accordingly
it was at once committed to the ground,
along with four others found in different houses,
with all due reverence. His wife, whose maiden
name was Lady Muriel Orme, had been married
to him on the very morning on which he undertook
his self-sacrificing mission.</i></p>
<p><i>Next we record the Rev. Walter Saunders,
Wesleyan Minister. His death is believed to
have taken place two or three weeks ago, as the
words &lsquo;Died October 5&rsquo; were found written on
the wall of the room which he is known to have
occupied&mdash;the house being shut up, and apparently
not having been entered for some time.</i></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_286">286</div>
<p><i>Last&mdash;though not a whit behind the other
four in glorious self-denial and devotion to duty&mdash;let
us record the name of Father Francis,
a young Jesuit Priest who had been only a few
months in the place. He had not been dead
many hours when the exploring party came upon
the body, which was identified, beyond the possibility
of doubt, by the dress, and by the crucifix
which was, like the young Doctor&rsquo;s Testament,
clasped closely to his heart.</i></p>
<p><i>Since reaching the hospital, two of the men
and one of the children have died. Hope is entertained
for all the others: though there are
two or three cases where the vital powers seem
to be so entirely exhausted that it is but &lsquo;hoping
against hope&rsquo; to regard ultimate recovery as
even possible.</i></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_287">287</div>
<h2 id="c19">CHAPTER XIX.
<br /><span class="small">A FAIRY-DUET.</span></h2>
<p>The year&mdash;what an eventful year it had
been for me!&mdash;was drawing to a close, and
the brief wintry day hardly gave light enough
to recognise the old familiar objects, bound up
with so many happy memories, as the train
glided round the last bend into the station,
and the hoarse cry of &ldquo;Elveston! Elveston!&rdquo;
resounded along the platform.</p>
<p>It was sad to return to the place, and to
feel that I should never again see the glad
smile of welcome, that had awaited me here
so few months ago. &ldquo;And yet, if I were to
<span class="pb" id="Page_288">288</span>
find him here,&rdquo; I muttered, as in solitary state
I followed the porter, who was wheeling my
luggage on a barrow, &ldquo;and if he <i>were</i> to &lsquo;<i>strike
a sudden hand in mine, And ask a thousand
things of home</i>,&rsquo; I should not&mdash;no, &lsquo;<i>I should
not feel it to be strange</i>&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having given directions to have my luggage
taken to my old lodgings, I strolled off alone,
to pay a visit, before settling down in my own
quarters, to my dear old friends&mdash;for such I
indeed felt them to be, though it was barely
half a year since first we met&mdash;the Earl and
his widowed daughter.</p>
<p>The shortest way, as I well remembered, was
to cross through the churchyard. I pushed
open the little wicket-gate and slowly took my
way among the solemn memorials of the quiet
dead, thinking of the many who had, during
the past year, disappeared from the place, and
had gone to &lsquo;join the majority.&rsquo; A very few
steps brought me in sight of the object of my
search. Lady Muriel, dressed in the deepest
mourning, her face hidden by a long crape veil,
was kneeling before a little marble cross, round
which she was fastening a wreath of flowers.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_289">289</div>
<p>The cross stood on a piece of level turf, unbroken
by any mound, and I knew that it was
simply a memorial-cross, for one whose dust
reposed elsewhere, even before reading the
simple inscription:&mdash;</p>
<p class="center"><i>In loving Memory of</i>
<br />ARTHUR FORESTER, M.D.
<br /><i>whose mortal remains lie buried by the sea:
<br />whose spirit has returned to God who gave it</i>.</p>
<p class="center"><i class="b">&ldquo;Greater love hath no man than this, that
<br />a man lay down his life for his friends.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>She threw back her veil on seeing me approach,
and came forwards to meet me, with a
quiet smile, and far more self-possessed than I
could have expected.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is quite like old times, seeing <i>you</i> here
again!&rdquo; she said, in tones of genuine pleasure.
&ldquo;Have you been to see my father?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; I said: &ldquo;I was on my way there, and
came through here as the shortest way. I
hope he is well, and you also?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks, we are both quite well. And you?
Are you any better yet?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_290">290</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not much better, I fear: but no worse, I
am thankful to say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us sit here awhile, and have a quiet
chat,&rdquo; she said. The calmness&mdash;almost indifference&mdash;of
her manner quite took me by
surprise. I little guessed what a fierce restraint
she was putting upon herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One can be so quiet here,&rdquo; she resumed.
&ldquo;I come here every&mdash;every day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is very peaceful,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You got my letter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but I delayed writing. It is so hard
to say&mdash;on <i>paper</i>&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know. It was kind of you. You were
with us when we saw the last of&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; She
paused a moment, and went on more hurriedly.
&ldquo;I went down to the harbour several times,
but no one knows which of those vast graves it
is. However, they showed me the house he
died in: that was some comfort. I stood in the
very room where&mdash;where&mdash;&mdash;.&rdquo; She struggled
in vain to go on. The flood-gates had
given way at last, and the outburst of grief was
the most terrible I had ever witnessed. Totally
regardless of my presence, she flung herself
<span class="pb" id="Page_291">291</span>
down on the turf, burying her face in the grass,
and with her hands clasped round the little
marble cross, &ldquo;Oh, my darling, my darling!&rdquo;
she sobbed. &ldquo;And God meant your life to be
so beautiful!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img" id="fig27">
<img src="images/i291.jpg" alt="IN THE CHURCH-YARD" width="500" height="453" />
<p class="center small">IN THE CHURCH-YARD</p>
</div>
<p>I was startled to hear, thus repeated by Lady
Muriel, the very words of the darling child
whom I had seen weeping so bitterly over
the dead hare. Had some mysterious influence
passed, from that sweet fairy-spirit, ere
<span class="pb" id="Page_292">292</span>
she went back to Fairyland, into the human
spirit that loved her so dearly? The idea
seemed too wild for belief. And yet, are there
not &lsquo;<i>more things in heaven and earth than
are dreamt of in our philosophy</i>&rsquo;?</p>
<p>&ldquo;God <i>meant</i> it to be beautiful,&rdquo; I whispered,
&ldquo;and surely it <i>was</i> beautiful? God&rsquo;s purpose
never fails!&rdquo; I dared say no more, but rose
and left her. At the entrance-gate to the
Earl&rsquo;s house I waited, leaning on the gate and
watching the sun set, revolving many memories&mdash;some
happy, some sorrowful&mdash;until Lady
Muriel joined me.</p>
<p>She was quite calm again now. &ldquo;Do come
in,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;My father will be so pleased
to see you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man rose from his chair, with a smile,
to welcome me; but his self-command was far
less than his daughter&rsquo;s, and the tears coursed
down his face as he grasped both my hands
in his, and pressed them warmly.</p>
<p>My heart was too full to speak; and we all
sat silent for a minute or two. Then Lady
Muriel rang the bell for tea. &ldquo;You <i>do</i> take
five o&rsquo;clock tea, I know!&rdquo; she said to me,
<span class="pb" id="Page_293">293</span>
with the sweet playfulness of manner I remembered
so well, &ldquo;even though you <i>ca&rsquo;n&rsquo;t</i> work
your wicked will on the Law of Gravity, and
make the teacups descend into Infinite Space,
a little faster than the tea!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This remark gave the tone to our conversation.
By a tacit mutual consent, we avoided,
during this our first meeting after her great
sorrow, the painful topics that filled our thoughts,
and talked like light-hearted children who had
never known a care.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you ever ask yourself the question,&rdquo;
Lady Muriel began, <i>&agrave; propos</i> of nothing,
&ldquo;what is the <i>chief</i> advantage of being a Man
instead of a Dog?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, indeed,&rdquo; I said: &ldquo;but I think there
are advantages on the <i>Dog&rsquo;s</i> side of the
question, as well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No doubt,&rdquo; she replied, with that pretty
mock-gravity that became her so well: &ldquo;but,
on <i>Man&rsquo;s</i> side, the chief advantage seems to
me to consist in <i>having pockets</i>! It was borne
in upon me&mdash;upon <i>us</i>, I should say; for my
father and I were returning from a walk&mdash;only
yesterday. We met a dog carrying home
<span class="pb" id="Page_294">294</span>
a bone. What it wanted it for, I&rsquo;ve no idea:
certainly there was no <i>meat</i> on it&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>A strange sensation came over me, that I
had heard all this, or something exactly like
it, before: and I almost expected her next
words to be &ldquo;perhaps he meant to make a
cloak for the winter?&rdquo; However what she
really said was &ldquo;and my father tried to account
for it by some wretched joke about <i>pro
bono publico</i>. Well, the dog laid down the
bone&mdash;<i>not</i> in disgust with the pun, which
would have shown it to be a dog of taste&mdash;but
simply to rest its jaws, poor thing! I
<i>did</i> pity it so! Won&rsquo;t you join my <i>Charitable
Association for supplying dogs with pockets</i>?
How would <i>you</i> like to have to carry your
walking-stick in your mouth?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ignoring the difficult question as to the
<i>raison d&rsquo;&ecirc;tre</i> of a walking-stick, supposing one
had no <i>hands</i>, I mentioned a curious instance,
I had once witnessed, of reasoning by a dog.
A gentleman, with a lady, and child, and a
large dog, were down at the end of a pier on
which I was walking. To amuse his child,
I suppose, the gentleman put down on the
<span class="pb" id="Page_295">295</span>
ground his umbrella and the lady&rsquo;s parasol,
and then led the way to the other end of the
pier, from which he sent the dog back for the
deserted articles. I was watching with some
curiosity. The dog came racing back to where
I stood, but found an unexpected difficulty in
picking up the things it had come for. With
the umbrella in its mouth, its jaws were so
far apart that it could get no firm grip on the
parasol. After two or three failures, it paused
and considered the matter.</p>
<p>Then it put down the umbrella and began
with the parasol. Of course that didn&rsquo;t open
its jaws nearly so wide, and it was able to
get a good hold of the umbrella, and galloped
off in triumph. One couldn&rsquo;t doubt that it had
gone through a real train of logical thought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I entirely agree with you,&rdquo; said Lady
Muriel: &ldquo;but don&rsquo;t orthodox writers condemn
that view, as putting Man on the level of the
lower animals? Don&rsquo;t they draw a sharp
boundary-line between Reason and Instinct?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That certainly <i>was</i> the orthodox view, a
generation ago,&rdquo; said the Earl. &ldquo;The truth
of Religion seemed ready to stand or fall with
<span class="pb" id="Page_296">296</span>
the assertion that Man was the only reasoning
animal. But that is at an end now. Man can
still claim <i>certain</i> monopolies&mdash;for instance,
such a use of <i>language</i> as enables us to utilise
the work of many, by &lsquo;division of labour.&rsquo;
But the belief, that we have a monopoly of
<i>Reason</i>, has long been swept away. Yet no
catastrophe has followed. As some old poet
says, &lsquo;<i>God is where he was</i>.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most religious believers would <i>now</i> agree
with Bishop Butler,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and not reject
a line of argument, even if it led straight to
the conclusion that animals have some kind
of <i>soul</i>, which survives their bodily death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I <i>would</i> like to know <i>that</i> to be true!&rdquo;
Lady Muriel exclaimed. &ldquo;If only for the sake
of the poor horses. Sometimes I&rsquo;ve thought
that, if anything <i>could</i> make me cease to believe
in a God of perfect justice, it would be
the sufferings of horses&mdash;without guilt to deserve
it, and without any compensation!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is only part of the great Riddle,&rdquo; said
the Earl, &ldquo;why innocent beings <i>ever</i> suffer. It
<i>is</i> a great strain on Faith&mdash;but not a <i>breaking</i>
strain, I think.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_297">297</div>
<p>&ldquo;The sufferings of <i>horses</i>,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;are
chiefly caused by <i>Man&rsquo;s</i> cruelty. So <i>that</i> is
merely one of the many instances of Sin
causing suffering to others than the Sinner
himself. But don&rsquo;t you find a <i>greater</i> difficulty
in sufferings inflicted by animals upon
each other? For instance, a cat playing with
a mouse. Assuming it to have no <i>moral</i>
responsibility, isn&rsquo;t that a greater mystery
than a man over-driving a horse?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it <i>is</i>,&rdquo; said Lady Muriel, looking a
mute appeal to her father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What right have we to make that assumption?&rdquo;
said the Earl. &ldquo;<i>Many</i> of our religious
difficulties are merely deductions from unwarranted
assumptions. The wisest answer to
most of them, is, I think, &lsquo;<i>behold, we know not
anything</i>.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mentioned &lsquo;division of labour,&rsquo; just
now,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Surely it is carried to a
wonderful perfection in a hive of bees?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So wonderful&mdash;so entirely super-human&mdash;&rdquo;
said the Earl, &ldquo;and so entirely inconsistent
with the intelligence they show in other
ways&mdash;that I feel no doubt at all that it is
<span class="pb" id="Page_298">298</span>
<i>pure</i> Instinct, and <i>not</i>, as some hold, a very
high order of Reason. Look at the utter
stupidity of a bee, trying to find its way out of
an open window! It <i>doesn&rsquo;t</i> try, in any reasonable
sense of the word: it simply bangs
itself about! We should call a puppy <i>imbecile</i>,
that behaved so. And yet we are asked to
believe that its intellectual level is above Sir
Isaac Newton!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you hold that <i>pure</i> Instinct contains
no <i>Reason</i> at all?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the contrary,&rdquo; said the Earl, &ldquo;I hold
that the work of a bee-hive involves Reason of
the <i>highest</i> order. But none of it is done by
the <i>Bee</i>. <i>God</i> has reasoned it all out, and has
put into the mind of the Bee the <i>conclusions</i>,
only, of the reasoning process.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how do their minds come to work
<i>together</i>?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What right have we to assume that they
<i>have</i> minds?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Special pleading, special pleading!&rdquo; Lady
Muriel cried, in a most unfilial tone of triumph.
&ldquo;Why, you yourself said, just now, &lsquo;the mind
of the Bee&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_299">299</div>
<p>&ldquo;But I did <i>not</i> say &lsquo;<i>minds</i>,&rsquo; my child,&rdquo; the
Earl gently replied. &ldquo;It has occurred to me,
as the most probable solution of the &lsquo;Bee&rsquo;-mystery,
that a swarm of Bees <i>have only one
mind among them</i>. We often see one mind
animating a most complex collection of limbs
and organs, <i>when joined together</i>. How do
we know that any material connection is necessary?
May not mere neighbourhood be
enough? If so, a swarm of bees is simply a
single animal whose many limbs are not quite
close together!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a bewildering thought,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;and
needs a night&rsquo;s rest to grasp it properly. Reason
and Instinct <i>both</i> tell me I ought to go
home. So, good-night!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll &lsquo;set&rsquo; you part of the way,&rdquo; said Lady
Muriel. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had no walk to-day. It will
do me good, and I have more to say to you.
Shall we go through the wood? It will be
pleasanter than over the common, even though
it <i>is</i> getting a little dark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We turned aside into the shade of interlacing
boughs, which formed an architecture of almost
perfect symmetry, grouped into lovely groined
<span class="pb" id="Page_300">300</span>
arches, or running out, far as the eye could
follow, into endless aisles, and chancels, and
naves, like some ghostly cathedral, fashioned
out of the dream of a moon-struck poet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Always, in this wood,&rdquo; she began after a
pause (silence seemed natural in this dim
solitude), &ldquo;I begin thinking of Fairies! May
I ask you a question?&rdquo; she added hesitatingly.
&ldquo;Do you believe in Fairies?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The momentary impulse was so strong to
tell her of my experiences in this very wood,
that I had to make a real effort to keep back
the words that rushed to my lips. &ldquo;If you
mean, by &lsquo;believe,&rsquo; &lsquo;believe in their <i>possible</i>
existence,&rsquo; I say &lsquo;Yes.&rsquo; For their <i>actual</i> existence,
of course, one would need <i>evidence</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were saying, the other day,&rdquo; she went
on, &ldquo;that you would accept <i>anything</i>, on good
evidence, that was not <i>&agrave; priori</i> impossible.
And I think you named <i>Ghosts</i> as an instance
of a <i>provable</i> phenomenon. Would <i>Fairies</i> be
another instance?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I think so.&rdquo; And again it was hard
to check the wish to say more: but I was not
yet sure of a sympathetic listener.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_301">301</div>
<p>&ldquo;And have you any theory as to what sort
of place they would occupy in Creation? Do
tell me what you think about them! Would
they, for instance (supposing such beings to
exist), would they have any moral responsibility?
I mean&rdquo; (and the light bantering tone
suddenly changed to one of deep seriousness)
&ldquo;would they be capable of <i>sin</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They can reason&mdash;on a lower level, perhaps,
than men and women&mdash;never rising, I
think, above the faculties of a child; and they
have a moral sense, most surely. Such a
being, without <i>free will</i>, would be an absurdity.
So I am driven to the conclusion that they
<i>are</i> capable of sin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You believe in them?&rdquo; she cried delightedly,
with a sudden motion as if about to
clap her hands. &ldquo;Now tell me, have you any
reason for it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And still I strove to keep back the revelation
I felt sure was coming. &ldquo;I believe that
there is <i>life</i> everywhere&mdash;not <i>material</i> only,
not merely what is palpable to our senses&mdash;but
immaterial and invisible as well. We believe
in our own immaterial essence&mdash;call it &lsquo;soul,&rsquo;
<span class="pb" id="Page_302">302</span>
or &lsquo;spirit,&rsquo; or what you will. Why should not
other similar essences exist around us, <i>not</i>
linked on to a visible and <i>material</i> body?
Did not God make this swarm of happy insects,
to dance in this sunbeam for one hour of
bliss, for no other object, that we can imagine,
than to swell the sum of conscious happiness?
And where shall we dare to draw the line, and
say &lsquo;He has made all these and no more&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes!&rdquo; she assented, watching me with
sparkling eyes. &ldquo;But these are only reasons
for not <i>denying</i>. You have more reasons than
this, have you not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, yes,&rdquo; I said, feeling I might safely
tell all now. &ldquo;And I could not find a fitter
time or place to say it. I have <i>seen</i> them&mdash;and
in this very wood!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lady Muriel asked no more questions. Silently
she paced at my side, with head bowed
down and hands clasped tightly together.
Only, as my tale went on, she drew a little
short quick breath now and then, like a child
panting with delight. And I told her what I
had never yet breathed to any other listener,
of my double life, and, more than that (for
<span class="pb" id="Page_303">303</span>
<i>mine</i> might have been but a noonday-dream),
of the double life of those two dear children.</p>
<p>And when I told her of Bruno&rsquo;s wild gambols,
she laughed merrily; and when I spoke of
Sylvie&rsquo;s sweetness and her utter unselfishness
and trustful love, she drew a deep breath, like
one who hears at last some precious tidings for
which the heart has ached for a long while;
and the happy tears chased one another down
her cheeks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have often longed to meet an angel,&rdquo; she
whispered, so low that I could hardly catch the
words. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m <i>so</i> glad I&rsquo;ve seen Sylvie! My
heart went out to the child the first moment
that I saw her&mdash;&mdash; Listen!&rdquo; she broke off
suddenly. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s Sylvie singing! I&rsquo;m sure
of it! Don&rsquo;t you know her voice?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have heard <i>Bruno</i> sing, more than once,&rdquo;
I said: &ldquo;but I never heard Sylvie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have only heard her <i>once</i>,&rdquo; said Lady
Muriel. &ldquo;It was that day when you brought
us those mysterious flowers. The children
had run out into the garden; and I saw Eric
coming in that way, and went to the window
to meet him: and Sylvie was singing, under
<span class="pb" id="Page_304">304</span>
the trees, a song I had never heard before.
The words were something like &lsquo;I think it is
Love, I feel it is Love.&rsquo; Her voice sounded
far away, like a dream, but it was beautiful
beyond all words&mdash;as sweet as an infant&rsquo;s
first smile, or the first gleam of the white cliffs
when one is coming <i>home</i> after weary years&mdash;a
voice that seemed to fill one&rsquo;s whole
being with peace and heavenly thoughts&mdash;&mdash; Listen!&rdquo;
she cried, breaking off again in her
excitement. &ldquo;That <i>is</i> her voice, and that&rsquo;s
the very song!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I could distinguish no words, but there was
a dreamy sense of music in the air that seemed
to grow ever louder and louder, as if coming
nearer to us. We stood quite silent, and in
another minute the two children appeared,
coming straight towards us through an arched
opening among the trees. Each had an arm
round the other, and the setting sun shed a
golden halo round their heads, like what one
sees in pictures of saints. They were looking
in our direction, but evidently did not see us,
and I soon made out that Lady Muriel had
for once passed into a condition familiar to
<i>me</i>, that we were both of us &lsquo;eerie,&rsquo; and that,
though we could see the children so plainly,
we were quite invisible to <i>them</i>.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig28">
<img src="images/i303.jpg" alt="A FAIRY-DUET" width="500" height="739" />
<p class="center small">A FAIRY-DUET</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_305">305</div>
<p>The song ceased just as they came into
sight: but, to my delight, Bruno instantly said
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s sing it all again, Sylvie! It <i>did</i> sound
so pretty!&rdquo; And Sylvie replied &ldquo;Very well.
It&rsquo;s <i>you</i> to begin, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Bruno began, in the sweet childish treble
I knew so well:&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Say, what is the spell, when her fledgelings are cheeping,</p>
<p class="t">That lures the bird home to her nest?</p>
<p class="t0">Or wakes the tired mother, whose infant is weeping,</p>
<p class="t">To cuddle and croon it to rest?</p>
<p class="t0">What&rsquo;s the magic that charms the glad babe in her arms,</p>
<p class="t">Till it cooes with the voice of the dove?&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>And now ensued quite the strangest of all
the strange experiences that marked the wonderful
year whose history I am writing&mdash;the
experience of <i>first</i> hearing Sylvie&rsquo;s voice in
song. Her part was a very short one&mdash;only a
few words&mdash;and she sang it timidly, and very
low indeed, scarcely audibly, but the <i>sweetness</i>
<span class="pb" id="Page_306">306</span>
of her voice was simply indescribable; I have
never heard any earthly music like it.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis a secret, and so let us whisper it low&mdash;</p>
<p class="t">And the name of the secret is Love!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>On me the first effect of her voice was a
sudden sharp pang that seemed to pierce
through one&rsquo;s very heart. (I had felt such a
pang only once before in my life, and it had
been from <i>seeing</i> what, at the moment, realised
one&rsquo;s idea of perfect beauty&mdash;it was in a
London exhibition, where, in making my way
through a crowd, I suddenly met, face to face,
a child of quite unearthly beauty.) Then came
a rush of burning tears to the eyes, as though
one could weep one&rsquo;s soul away for pure delight.
And lastly there fell on me a sense of
awe that was almost terror&mdash;some such feeling
as Moses must have had when he heard the
words &ldquo;<i>Put off thy shoes from off thy feet,
for the place whereon thou standest is holy
ground</i>.&rdquo; The figures of the children became
vague and shadowy, like glimmering
meteors: while their voices rang together in
exquisite harmony as they sang:&mdash;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_307">307</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t2">&ldquo;For I think it is Love,</p>
<p class="t2">For I feel it is Love,</p>
<p class="t0">For I&rsquo;m sure it is nothing but Love!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>By this time I could see them clearly once
more. Bruno again sang by himself:&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Say, whence is the voice that, when anger is burning,</p>
<p class="t">Bids the whirl of the tempest to cease?</p>
<p class="t0">That stirs the vexed soul with an aching&mdash;a yearning</p>
<p class="t">For the brotherly hand-grip of peace?</p>
<p class="t0">Whence the music that fills all our being&mdash;that thrills</p>
<p class="t">Around us, beneath, and above?&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Sylvie sang more courageously, this time:
the words seemed to carry her away, out of
herself:&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis a secret: none knows how it comes, how it goes:</p>
<p class="t">But the name of the secret is Love!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>And clear and strong the chorus rang out:&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t2">&ldquo;For I think it is Love,</p>
<p class="t2">For I feel it is Love,</p>
<p class="t0">For I&rsquo;m sure it is nothing but Love!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_308">308</div>
<p>Once more we heard Bruno&rsquo;s delicate little
voice alone:&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Say whose is the skill that paints valley and hill,</p>
<p class="t">Like a picture so fair to the sight?</p>
<p class="t0">That flecks the green meadow with sunshine and shadow,</p>
<p class="t">Till the little lambs leap with delight?&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>And again uprose that silvery voice, whose
angelic sweetness I could hardly bear:&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis a secret untold to hearts cruel and cold,</p>
<p class="t">Though &rsquo;tis sung, by the angels above,</p>
<p class="t0">In notes that ring clear for the ears that can hear&mdash;</p>
<p class="t">And the name of the secret is Love!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>And then Bruno joined in again with</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t2">&ldquo;For I think it is Love,</p>
<p class="t2">For I feel it is Love,</p>
<p class="t0">For I&rsquo;m sure it is nothing but Love!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;That <i>are</i> pretty!&rdquo; the little fellow exclaimed,
as the children passed us&mdash;so closely that we
drew back a little to make room for them, and
it seemed we had only to reach out a hand to
touch them: but this we did not attempt.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_309">309</div>
<p>&ldquo;No use to try and stop them!&rdquo; I said, as
they passed away into the shadows. &ldquo;Why,
they could not even <i>see</i> us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No use at all,&rdquo; Lady Muriel echoed with a
sigh. &ldquo;One would <i>like</i> to meet them again, in
living form! But I feel, somehow, <i>that</i> can
never be. They have passed out of <i>our</i> lives!&rdquo;
She sighed again; and no more was said, till
we came out into the main road, at a point
near my lodgings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I will leave you here,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I
want to get back before dark: and I have a
cottage-friend to visit, first. Good night, dear
friend! Let us see you soon&mdash;and often!&rdquo;
she added, with an affectionate warmth that
went to my very heart. &ldquo;<i>For those are few
we hold as dear!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good night!&rdquo; I answered. &ldquo;Tennyson
said that of a worthier friend than me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tennyson didn&rsquo;t know what he was talking
about!&rdquo; she saucily rejoined, with a touch of
her old childish gaiety; and we parted.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_310">310</div>
<h2 id="c20">CHAPTER XX.
<br /><span class="small">GAMMON AND SPINACH.</span></h2>
<p>My landlady&rsquo;s welcome had an extra heartiness
about it: and though, with a rare delicacy
of feeling, she made no direct allusion to the
friend whose companionship had done so much
to brighten life for me, I felt sure that it was a
kindly sympathy with my solitary state that
made her so specially anxious to do all she
could think of to ensure my comfort, and make
me feel at home.</p>
<p>The lonely evening seemed long and tedious:
yet I lingered on, watching the dying fire, and
letting Fancy mould the red embers into the
<span class="pb" id="Page_311">311</span>
forms and faces belonging to bygone scenes.
Now it seemed to be Bruno&rsquo;s roguish smile
that sparkled for a moment, and died away:
now it was Sylvie&rsquo;s rosy cheek: and now the
Professor&rsquo;s jolly round face, beaming with delight.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re welcome, my little ones!&rdquo; he
seemed to say. And then the red coal, which
for the moment embodied the dear old Professor,
began to wax dim, and with its dying
lustre the words seemed to die away into silence.
I seized the poker, and with an artful
touch or two revived the waning glow, while
Fancy&mdash;no coy minstrel she&mdash;sang me once
again the magic strain I loved to hear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re welcome, little ones!&rdquo; the cheery
voice repeated. &ldquo;I told them you were
coming. Your rooms are all ready for you.
And the Emperor and the Empress&mdash;well,
I think they&rsquo;re rather pleased than otherwise!
In fact, Her Highness said &lsquo;I hope they&rsquo;ll be
in time for the Banquet!&rsquo; Those were her
very words, I assure you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will Uggug be at the Banquet?&rdquo; Bruno
asked. And both children looked uneasy at the
dismal suggestion.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_312">312</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, of course he will!&rdquo; chuckled the Professor.
&ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s his <i>birthday</i>, don&rsquo;t you
know? And his health will be drunk, and all
that sort of thing. What would the Banquet be
without <i>him</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ever so much nicer,&rdquo; said Bruno. But he
said it in a <i>very</i> low voice, and nobody but
Sylvie heard him.</p>
<p>The Professor chuckled again. &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be a
jolly Banquet, now <i>you&rsquo;ve</i> come, my little man!
I <i>am</i> so glad to see you again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I &rsquo;fraid we&rsquo;ve been very long in coming,&rdquo;
Bruno politely remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, yes,&rdquo; the Professor assented. &ldquo;However,
you&rsquo;re very short now you&rsquo;re come: that&rsquo;s
<i>some</i> comfort.&rdquo; And he went on to enumerate
the plans for the day. &ldquo;The Lecture comes
first,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;<i>That</i> the Empress <i>insists</i> on.
She says people will eat so much at the Banquet,
they&rsquo;ll be too sleepy to attend to the
Lecture afterwards&mdash;and perhaps she&rsquo;s right.
There&rsquo;ll just be a little <i>refreshment</i>, when the
people first arrive&mdash;as a kind of surprise
for the Empress, you know. Ever since
she&rsquo;s been&mdash;well, not <i>quite</i> so clever as she
<span class="pb" id="Page_313">313</span>
once was&mdash;we&rsquo;ve found it desirable to concoct
little surprises for her. <i>Then</i> comes the
Lecture&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What? The Lecture you were getting
ready&mdash;ever so long ago?&rdquo; Sylvie enquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;that&rsquo;s the one,&rdquo; the Professor rather
reluctantly admitted. &ldquo;It <i>has</i> taken a goodish
time to prepare. I&rsquo;ve got so many other
things to attend to. For instance, I&rsquo;m Court-Physician.
I have to keep all the Royal
Servants in good health&mdash;and that reminds
me!&rdquo; he cried, ringing the bell in a great
hurry. &ldquo;This is Medicine-Day! We only
give Medicine once a week. If we were to
begin giving it every day, the bottles would
<i>soon</i> be empty!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if they were ill on the <i>other</i> days?&rdquo;
Sylvie suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, ill on the wrong <i>day</i>!&rdquo; exclaimed
the Professor. &ldquo;Oh, that would never do!
A Servant would be dismissed <i>at once</i>, who
was ill on the wrong day! This is the Medicine
for <i>today</i>,&rdquo; he went on, taking down a
large jug from a shelf. &ldquo;I mixed it, myself,
first thing this morning. Taste it!&rdquo; he said,
<span class="pb" id="Page_314">314</span>
holding out the jug to Bruno. &ldquo;Dip in your
finger, and taste it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bruno did so, and made such an excruciatingly
wry face that Sylvie exclaimed, in
alarm, &ldquo;Oh, Bruno, you mustn&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s welly extremely nasty!&rdquo; Bruno said,
as his face resumed its natural shape.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nasty?&rdquo; said the Professor. &ldquo;Why, of
<i>course</i> it is! What would Medicine be, if it
wasn&rsquo;t <i>nasty</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nice,&rdquo; said Bruno.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was going to say&mdash;&rdquo; the Professor
faltered, rather taken aback by the promptness
of Bruno&rsquo;s reply, &ldquo;&mdash;that <i>that</i> would
never do! Medicine <i>has</i> to be nasty, you
know. Be good enough to take this jug,
down into the Servants&rsquo; Hall,&rdquo; he said to the
footman who answered the bell: &ldquo;and tell
them it&rsquo;s their Medicine for <i>today</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which of them is to drink it?&rdquo; the footman
asked, as he carried off the jug.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ve not settled <i>that</i> yet!&rdquo; the Professor
briskly replied. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come and settle
that, soon. Tell them not to begin, on any
account, till I come! It&rsquo;s really <i>wonderful</i>,&rdquo;
<span class="pb" id="Page_315">315</span>
he said, turning to the children, &ldquo;the success
I&rsquo;ve had in curing Diseases! Here are
some of my memoranda.&rdquo; He took down
from the shelf a heap of little bits of paper,
pinned together in twos and threes. &ldquo;Just
look at <i>this</i> set, now. &lsquo;<i>Under-Cook Number
Thirteen recovered from Common Fever&mdash;Febris
Communis</i>.&rsquo; And now see what&rsquo;s pinned
to it. &lsquo;<i>Gave Under-Cook Number Thirteen a
Double Dose of Medicine</i>.&rsquo; <i>That&rsquo;s</i> something
to be proud of, <i>isn&rsquo;t</i> it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But which happened <i>first</i>?&rdquo; said Sylvie,
looking very much puzzled.</p>
<p>The Professor examined the papers carefully.
&ldquo;They are not <i>dated</i>, I find,&rdquo; he said
with a slightly dejected air: &ldquo;so I fear I ca&rsquo;n&rsquo;t
tell you. But they <i>both</i> happened: there&rsquo;s no
doubt of <i>that</i>. The <i>Medicine&rsquo;s</i> the great thing,
you know. The <i>Diseases</i> are much less important.
You can keep a <i>Medicine</i>, for years
and years: but nobody ever wants to keep
a <i>Disease</i>! By the way, come and look at
the platform. The Gardener asked me to
come and see if it would do. We may as
well go before it gets dark.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_316">316</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d like to, very much!&rdquo; Sylvie replied.
&ldquo;Come, Bruno, put on your hat. Don&rsquo;t keep
the dear Professor waiting!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ca&rsquo;n&rsquo;t find my hat!&rdquo; the little fellow sadly
replied. &ldquo;I were rolling it about. And it&rsquo;s
rolled itself away!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe it&rsquo;s rolled in <i>there</i>,&rdquo; Sylvie suggested,
pointing to a dark recess, the door of
which stood half open: and Bruno ran in to
look. After a minute he came slowly out
again, looking very grave, and carefully shut
the cupboard-door after him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It aren&rsquo;t in there,&rdquo; he said, with such unusual
solemnity, that Sylvie&rsquo;s curiosity was
roused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What <i>is</i> in there, Bruno?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s cobwebs&mdash;and two spiders&mdash;&rdquo;
Bruno thoughtfully replied, checking off the
catalogue on his fingers, &ldquo;&mdash;and the cover
of a picture-book&mdash;and a tortoise&mdash;and a
dish of nuts&mdash;and an old man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An old man!&rdquo; cried the Professor, trotting
across the room in great excitement. &ldquo;Why,
it must be the Other Professor, that&rsquo;s been lost
for ever so long!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_317">317</div>
<div class="img" id="fig29">

<p class="center small">THE OTHER PROFESSOR FOUND</p>
</div>
<p>He opened the
door of the cupboard
wide: and
there he was, the
Other Professor,
sitting in a chair,
with a book on
his knee, and in
the act of helping
himself to a
nut from a dish,
which he had taken
down off a
shelf just within
his reach. He
looked round at
us, but said nothing till he had cracked and
eaten the nut. Then he asked the old question.
&ldquo;Is the Lecture all ready?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll begin in an hour,&rdquo; the Professor said,
evading the question. &ldquo;First, we must have
something to surprise the Empress. And then
comes the Banquet&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Banquet!&rdquo; cried the Other Professor,
springing up, and filling the room with a cloud
<span class="pb" id="Page_318">318</span>
of dust. &ldquo;Then I&rsquo;d better go and&mdash;and brush
myself a little. What a state I&rsquo;m in!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He <i>does</i> want brushing!&rdquo; the Professor
said, with a critical air, &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s your hat, little
man! I had put it on by mistake. I&rsquo;d quite
forgotten I had <i>one</i> on, already. Let&rsquo;s go
and look at the platform.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And there&rsquo;s that nice old Gardener singing
still!&rdquo; Bruno exclaimed in delight, as we
went out into the garden. &ldquo;I do believe he&rsquo;s
been singing that very song ever since we
went away!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, of course he has!&rdquo; replied the Professor.
&ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t be the thing to leave off,
you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t be <i>what</i> thing?&rdquo; said Bruno:
but the Professor thought it best not to hear
the question. &ldquo;What are you doing with that
hedgehog?&rdquo; he shouted at the Gardener, whom
they found standing upon one foot, singing
softly to himself, and rolling a hedgehog up
and down with the other foot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I wanted fur to know what hedgehogs
lives on: so I be a-keeping this here
hedgehog&mdash;fur to see if it eats potatoes&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_319">319</div>
<p>&ldquo;Much better keep a potato,&rdquo; said the Professor;
&ldquo;and see if hedgehogs eat it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That be the roight way, sure-ly!&rdquo; the delighted
Gardener exclaimed. &ldquo;Be you come
to see the platform?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye, aye!&rdquo; the Professor cheerily replied.
&ldquo;And the children have come back, you see!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Gardener looked round at them with a
grin. Then he led the way to the Pavilion;
and as he went he sang:&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;He looked again, and found it was</p>
<p class="t">A Double Rule of Three:</p>
<p class="t0">&lsquo;And all its Mystery,&rsquo; he said,</p>
<p class="t">&lsquo;Is clear as day to me!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been <i>months</i> over that song,&rdquo; said
the Professor. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it finished yet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There be only one verse more,&rdquo; the Gardener
sadly replied. And, with tears streaming
down his cheeks, he sang the last verse:&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;He thought he saw an Argument</p>
<p class="t">That proved he was the Pope:</p>
<p class="t0">He looked again, and found it was</p>
<p class="t">A Bar of Mottled Soap.</p>
<p class="t0">&lsquo;A fact so dread,&rsquo; he faintly said,</p>
<p class="t">&lsquo;Extinguishes all hope!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_320">320</div>
<p>Choking with sobs, the Gardener hastily
stepped on a few yards ahead of the party,
to conceal his emotion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did <i>he</i> see the Bar of Mottled Soap?&rdquo;
Sylvie enquired, as we followed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, certainly!&rdquo; said the Professor. &ldquo;That
song is his own history, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tears of an ever-ready sympathy glittered
in Bruno&rsquo;s eyes. &ldquo;I&rsquo;s <i>welly</i> sorry he isn&rsquo;t the
Pope!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t <i>you</i> sorry, Sylvie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;I hardly know,&rdquo; Sylvie replied in
the vaguest manner. &ldquo;Would it make him
any happier?&rdquo; she asked the Professor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t make the <i>Pope</i> any happier,&rdquo;
said the Professor. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t the platform <i>lovely</i>?&rdquo;
he asked, as we entered the Pavilion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve put an extra beam under it!&rdquo; said the
Gardener, patting it affectionately as he spoke.
&ldquo;And now it&rsquo;s that strong, as&mdash;as a mad
elephant might dance upon it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you <i>very</i> much!&rdquo; the Professor
heartily rejoined. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that we shall
exactly require&mdash;but it&rsquo;s convenient to know.&rdquo;
And he led the children upon the platform, to
explain the arrangements to them. &ldquo;Here are
<span class="pb" id="Page_321">321</span>
three seats, you see, for the Emperor and the
Empress and Prince Uggug. But there must
be two more chairs here!&rdquo; he said, looking
down at the Gardener. &ldquo;One for Lady Sylvie,
and one for the smaller animal!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And may I help in the Lecture?&rdquo; said
Bruno. &ldquo;I can do some conjuring-tricks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s not exactly a <i>conjuring</i> lecture,&rdquo;
the Professor said, as he arranged some curious-looking
machines on the table. &ldquo;However,
what can you do? Did you ever go through a
table, for instance?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Often!&rdquo; said Bruno. &ldquo;<i>Haven&rsquo;t</i> I, Sylvie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Professor was evidently surprised, though
he tried not to show it. &ldquo;This must be looked
into,&rdquo; he muttered to himself, taking out a note-book.
&ldquo;And first&mdash;what kind of table?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell him!&rdquo; Bruno whispered to Sylvie,
putting his arms round her neck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell him yourself,&rdquo; said Sylvie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ca&rsquo;n&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Bruno. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a <i>bony</i> word.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; laughed Sylvie. &ldquo;You can
say it well enough, if you only try. Come!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Muddle&mdash;&rdquo; said Bruno. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a bit
of it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_322">322</div>
<p>&ldquo;<i>What</i> does he say?&rdquo; cried the bewildered
Professor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He means the multiplication-table,&rdquo; Sylvie
explained.</p>
<p>The Professor looked annoyed, and shut up
his note-book again. &ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s <i>quite</i> another
thing,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It are ever so many other things,&rdquo; said
Bruno. &ldquo;<i>Aren&rsquo;t</i> it, Sylvie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A loud blast of trumpets interrupted this
conversation. &ldquo;Why, the entertainment has
<i>begun</i>!&rdquo; the Professor exclaimed, as he hurried
the children into the Reception-Saloon.
&ldquo;I had no idea it was so late!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A small table, containing cake and wine,
stood in a corner of the Saloon; and here we
found the Emperor and Empress waiting for
us. The rest of the Saloon had been cleared
of furniture, to make room for the guests.
I was much struck by the great change a few
months had made in the faces of the Imperial
Pair. A vacant stare was now the <i>Emperor&rsquo;s</i>
usual expression; while over the face
of the <i>Empress</i> there flitted, ever and anon,
a meaningless smile.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_323">323</div>
<p>&ldquo;So you&rsquo;re come at last!&rdquo; the Emperor
sulkily remarked, as the Professor and the
children took their places. It was evident that
he was <i>very</i> much out of temper: and we were
not long in learning the cause of this. He did
not consider the preparations, made for the
Imperial party, to be such as suited their
rank. &ldquo;A common mahogany table!&rdquo; he
growled, pointing to it contemptuously with
his thumb. &ldquo;Why wasn&rsquo;t it made of gold, I
should like to know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would have taken a very long&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; the
Professor began, but the Emperor cut the
sentence short.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then the cake! Ordinary plum! Why
wasn&rsquo;t it made of&mdash;of&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; He broke off
again. &ldquo;Then the wine! Merely old Madeira!
Why wasn&rsquo;t it&mdash;&mdash;? Then this chair! That&rsquo;s
worst of all. Why wasn&rsquo;t it a throne? One
<i>might</i> excuse the other omissions, but I <i>ca&rsquo;n&rsquo;t</i>
get over the chair!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What <i>I</i> ca&rsquo;n&rsquo;t get over,&rdquo; said the Empress,
in eager sympathy with her angry husband, &ldquo;is
the <i>table</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pooh!&rdquo; said the Emperor.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_324">324</div>
<p>&ldquo;It is much to be regretted!&rdquo; the Professor
mildly replied, as soon as he had a chance
of speaking. After a moment&rsquo;s thought he
strengthened the remark. &ldquo;<i>Everything</i>,&rdquo; he
said, addressing Society in general, &ldquo;is <i>very
much</i> to be regretted!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A murmur of &ldquo;Hear, hear!&rdquo; rose from the
crowded Saloon.</p>
<p>There was a rather awkward pause: the
Professor evidently didn&rsquo;t know how to begin.
The Empress leant forwards, and whispered to
him. &ldquo;A few jokes, you know, Professor&mdash;just
to put people at their ease!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True, true, Madam!&rdquo; the Professor meekly
replied. &ldquo;This little boy&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Please</i> don&rsquo;t make any jokes about <i>me</i>!&rdquo;
Bruno exclaimed, his eyes filling with tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t if you&rsquo;d rather I didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said the
kind-hearted Professor. &ldquo;It was only something
about a Ship&rsquo;s Buoy: a harmless pun&mdash;but
it doesn&rsquo;t matter.&rdquo; Here he turned to the
crowd and addressed them in a loud voice.
&ldquo;Learn your A&rsquo;s!&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;Your B&rsquo;s!
Your C&rsquo;s! And your D&rsquo;s! <i>Then</i> you&rsquo;ll be at
your ease!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_325">325</div>
<p>There was a roar of laughter from all the
assembly, and then a great deal of confused
whispering. &ldquo;<i>What</i> was it he said? Something
about bees, I fancy&mdash;&mdash;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Empress smiled in her meaningless
way, and fanned herself. The poor Professor
looked at her timidly: he was clearly at his
wits&rsquo; end again, and hoping for another hint.
The Empress whispered again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some spinach, you know, Professor, as a
surprise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Professor beckoned to the Head-Cook,
and said something to him in a low voice.
Then the Head-Cook left the room, followed
by all the other cooks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s difficult to get things started,&rdquo; the Professor
remarked to Bruno. &ldquo;When once we
get started, it&rsquo;ll go on all right, you&rsquo;ll see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If oo want to startle people,&rdquo; said Bruno,
&ldquo;oo should put live frogs on their backs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here the cooks all came in again, in a
procession, the Head-Cook coming last and
carrying something, which the others tried to
hide by waving flags all round it. &ldquo;Nothing
but flags, Your Imperial Highness! Nothing
but flags!&rdquo; he kept repeating, as he set it
before her. Then all the flags were dropped
in a moment, as the Head-Cook raised the
cover from an enormous dish.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_326">326</div>
<div class="img" id="fig30">
<img src="images/i326.jpg" alt="&lsquo;HER IMPERIAL HIGHNESS IS SURPRISED!&rsquo;" width="764" height="500" />
<p class="center small">&lsquo;HER IMPERIAL HIGHNESS IS SURPRISED!&rsquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_327">327</div>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; the Empress said faintly, as
she put her spy-glass to her eye. &ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s
<i>Spinach</i>, I declare!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her Imperial Highness is surprised,&rdquo; the
Professor explained to the attendants: and
some of them clapped their hands. The
Head-Cook made a low bow, and in doing
so dropped a spoon on the table, as if by
accident, just within reach of the Empress,
who looked the other way and pretended not
to see it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I <i>am</i> surprised!&rdquo; the Empress said to
Bruno. &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a bit,&rdquo; said Bruno. &ldquo;I heard&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
but Sylvie put her hand over his mouth, and
spoke for him. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s rather tired, I think.
He wants the Lecture to begin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want the <i>supper</i> to begin,&rdquo; Bruno corrected
her.</p>
<p>The Empress took up the spoon in an
absent manner, and tried to balance it across
<span class="pb" id="Page_328">328</span>
the back of her hand, and in doing this she
dropped it into the dish: and, when she took
it out again, it was full of spinach. &ldquo;How
curious!&rdquo; she said, and put it into her mouth.
&ldquo;It tastes just like <i>real</i> spinach! I thought it
was an imitation&mdash;but I do believe it&rsquo;s real!&rdquo;
And she took another spoonful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It wo&rsquo;n&rsquo;t be real much longer,&rdquo; said Bruno.</p>
<p>But the Empress had had enough spinach
by this time, and somehow&mdash;I failed to notice
the exact process&mdash;we all found ourselves in
the Pavilion, and the Professor in the act of
beginning the long-expected Lecture.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_329">329</div>
<h2 id="c21">CHAPTER XXI.
<br /><span class="small">THE PROFESSOR&rsquo;S LECTURE.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;In Science&mdash;in fact, in most things&mdash;it is
usually best <i>to begin at the beginning</i>. In <i>some</i>
things, of course, it&rsquo;s better to begin at the
<i>other</i> end. For instance, if you wanted to
paint a dog green, it <i>might</i> be best to begin
with the <i>tail</i>, as it doesn&rsquo;t bite at <i>that</i> end.
And so&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May <i>I</i> help oo?&rdquo; Bruno interrupted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Help me to do <i>what</i>?&rdquo; said the puzzled
Professor, looking up for a moment, but keeping
his finger on the book he was reading from,
so as not to lose his place.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_330">330</div>
<p>&ldquo;To paint a dog green!&rdquo; cried Bruno. &ldquo;<i>Oo</i>
can begin wiz its <i>mouf</i>, and I&rsquo;ll&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; said the Professor. &ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t
got to the <i>Experiments</i> yet. And so,&rdquo; returning
to his note-book, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you the Axioms
of Science. After that I shall exhibit some
Specimens. Then I shall explain a Process or
two. And I shall conclude with a few Experiments.
An <i>Axiom</i>, you know, is a thing
that you accept without contradiction. For
instance, if I were to say &lsquo;Here we are!&rsquo;, that
would be accepted without any contradiction,
and it&rsquo;s a nice sort of remark to <i>begin</i> a conversation
with. So it would be an <i>Axiom</i>. Or
again, supposing I were to say &lsquo;Here we are
not!&rsquo; <i>that</i> would be&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&mdash;a fib!&rdquo; cried Bruno.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, <i>Bruno</i>!&rdquo; said Sylvie in a warning
whisper. &ldquo;Of course it would be an <i>Axiom</i>,
if the Professor said it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&mdash;that would be accepted, if people were
civil,&rdquo; continued the Professor; &ldquo;so it would
be <i>another</i> Axiom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It <i>might</i> be an Axledum,&rdquo; Bruno said:
&ldquo;but it wouldn&rsquo;t be <i>true</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_331">331</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ignorance of Axioms,&rdquo; the Lecturer continued,
&ldquo;is a great drawback in life. It wastes
so much time to have to say them over and
over again. For instance, take the Axiom &lsquo;<i>Nothing
is greater than itself</i>&rsquo;; that is, &lsquo;<i>Nothing
can contain itself</i>.&rsquo; How often you hear people
say &lsquo;He was so excited, he was quite unable
to contain himself,&rsquo; Why, <i>of course</i> he was
unable! The <i>excitement</i> had nothing to do
with it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say, look here, you know!&rdquo; said the
Emperor, who was getting a little restless.
&ldquo;How many Axioms are you going to give
us? At <i>this</i> rate, we sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t get to the <i>Experiments</i>
till to-morrow-week!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, sooner than <i>that</i>, I assure you!&rdquo; the
Professor replied, looking up in alarm. &ldquo;There
are only,&rdquo; (he referred to his notes again) &ldquo;only
<i>two</i> more, that are really <i>necessary</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Read &rsquo;em out, and get on to the <i>Specimens</i>,&rdquo;
grumbled the Emperor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The <i>First</i> Axiom,&rdquo; the Professor read out
in a great hurry, &ldquo;consists of these words,
&lsquo;<i>Whatever is, is</i>.&rsquo; And the Second consists of
<i>these</i> words, &lsquo;<i>Whatever isn&rsquo;t, isn&rsquo;t</i>.&rsquo; We will
<span class="pb" id="Page_332">332</span>
now go on to the <i>Specimens</i>. The first tray
contains Crystals and other Things.&rdquo; He
drew it towards him, and again referred to his
note-book. &ldquo;Some of the labels&mdash;owing to
insufficient adhesion&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Here he stopped
again, and carefully examined the page with
his eyeglass. &ldquo;I ca&rsquo;n&rsquo;t quite read the rest of
the sentence,&rdquo; he said at last, &ldquo;but it <i>means</i>
that the labels have come loose, and the Things
have got mixed&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let <i>me</i> stick &rsquo;em on again!&rdquo; cried Bruno
eagerly, and began licking them, like postage-stamps,
and dabbing them down upon the Crystals
and the other Things. But the Professor
hastily moved the tray out of his reach. &ldquo;They
<i>might</i> get fixed to the <i>wrong</i> Specimens, you
know!&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oo shouldn&rsquo;t have any <i>wrong</i> peppermints
in the tray!&rdquo; Bruno boldly replied. &ldquo;<i>Should</i>
he, Sylvie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Sylvie only shook her head.</p>
<p>The Professor heard him not. He had taken
up one of the bottles, and was carefully reading
the label through his eye-glass. &ldquo;Our first
Specimen&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; he announced, as he placed the
<span class="pb" id="Page_333">333</span>
bottle in front of the other Things, &ldquo;is&mdash;that
is, it is called&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; here he took it up, and
examined the label again, as if he thought
it might have changed since he last saw it,
&ldquo;is called Aqua Pura&mdash;common water&mdash;the
fluid that cheers&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hip! Hip! Hip!&rdquo; the Head-Cook began
enthusiastically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&mdash;but <i>not</i> inebriates!&rdquo; the Professor went
on quickly, but only just in time to check
the &ldquo;Hooroar!&rdquo; which was beginning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our second Specimen,&rdquo; he went on, carefully
opening a small jar, &ldquo;is&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; here he
removed the lid, and a large beetle instantly
darted out, and with an angry buzz went
straight out of the Pavilion, &ldquo;&mdash;is&mdash;or rather,
I should say,&rdquo; looking sadly into the empty
jar, &ldquo;it <i>was</i>&mdash;a curious kind of Blue Beetle.
Did any one happen to remark&mdash;as it went
past&mdash;three blue spots under each wing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nobody had remarked them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, well!&rdquo; the Professor said with a sigh.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pity. Unless you remark that kind of
thing <i>at the moment</i>, it&rsquo;s very apt to get overlooked!
The <i>next</i> Specimen, at any rate, will
<span class="pb" id="Page_334">334</span>
not fly away! It is&mdash;in short, or perhaps,
more correctly, at <i>length</i>&mdash;an <i>Elephant</i>. You
will observe&mdash;&mdash;.&rdquo; Here he beckoned to the
Gardener to come up on the platform, and with
his help began putting together what looked
like an enormous dog-kennel, with short tubes
projecting out of it on both sides.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we&rsquo;ve seen <i>Elephants</i> before,&rdquo; the
Emperor grumbled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but not through a <i>Megaloscope</i>!&rdquo; the
Professor eagerly replied. &ldquo;You know you
can&rsquo;t see a <i>Flea</i>, properly, without a <i>magnifying</i>-glass&mdash;what
we call a <i>Microscope</i>. Well,
just in the same way, you ca&rsquo;n&rsquo;t see an <i>Elephant</i>,
properly, without a <i>minimifying</i>-glass.
There&rsquo;s one in each of these little tubes. And
<i>this</i> is a <i>Megaloscope</i>! The Gardener will
now bring in the next Specimen. Please open
<i>both</i> curtains, down at the end there, and make
way for the Elephant!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a general rush to the sides of the
Pavilion, and all eyes were turned to the open
end, watching for the return of the Gardener,
who had gone away singing &ldquo;<i>He thought he
saw an Elephant That practised on a Fife!</i>&rdquo;
<span class="pb" id="Page_335">335</span>
There was silence for a minute: and then his
harsh voice was heard again in the distance.
&ldquo;<i>He looked again</i>&mdash;come up, then! <i>He looked
again, and found it was</i>&mdash;woa back! <i>and,
found it was A letter from his</i>&mdash;make way
there! He&rsquo;s a-coming!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img" id="fig31">

<p class="center small">&lsquo;HE THOUGHT HE SAW AN ELEPHANT&rsquo;</p>
</div>
<p>And in marched, or waddled&mdash;it is hard to
say which is the right word&mdash;an Elephant, on
its hind-legs, and playing on an enormous fife
which it held with its fore-feet.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_336">336</div>
<p>The Professor hastily threw open a large
door at the end of the Megaloscope, and the
huge animal, at a signal from the Gardener,
dropped the fife, and obediently trotted into
the machine, the door of which was at once
shut by the Professor. &ldquo;The Specimen is
now ready for observation!&rdquo; he proclaimed.
&ldquo;It is exactly the size of the Common Mouse&mdash;<i>Mus
Communis</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a general rush to the tubes,
and the spectators watched with delight the
minikin creature, as it playfully coiled its trunk
round the Professor&rsquo;s extended finger, finally
taking its stand upon the palm of his hand,
while he carefully lifted it out, and carried it off
to exhibit to the Imperial party.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it a <i>darling</i>?&rdquo; cried Bruno. &ldquo;May I
stroke it, please? I&rsquo;ll touch it <i>welly</i> gently!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Empress inspected it solemnly with her
eye-glass. &ldquo;It is very small,&rdquo; she said in a
deep voice. &ldquo;Smaller than elephants usually
are, I believe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Professor gave a start of delighted
surprise. &ldquo;Why, that&rsquo;s <i>true</i>!&rdquo; he murmured to
himself. Then louder, turning to the audience,
<span class="pb" id="Page_337">337</span>
&ldquo;Her Imperial Highness has made a remark
which is perfectly sensible!&rdquo; And a wild cheer
arose from that vast multitude.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The next Specimen,&rdquo; the Professor proclaimed,
after carefully placing the little Elephant
in the tray, among the Crystals and
other Things, &ldquo;is a <i>Flea</i>, which we will enlarge
for the purposes of observation.&rdquo; Taking a
small pill-box from the tray, he advanced to
the Megaloscope, and reversed all the tubes.
&ldquo;The Specimen is ready!&rdquo; he cried, with his
eye at one of the tubes, while he carefully
emptied the pill-box through a little hole at the
side. &ldquo;It is now the size of the Common
Horse&mdash;<i>Equus Communis</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was another general rush, to look
through the tubes, and the Pavilion rang with
shouts of delight, through which the Professor&rsquo;s
anxious tones could scarcely be heard. &ldquo;Keep
the door of the Microscope <i>shut</i>!&rdquo; he cried.
&ldquo;If the creature were to escape, <i>this size</i>, it
would&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; But the mischief was done. The
door had swung open, and in another moment
the Monster had got out, and was trampling
down the terrified, shrieking spectators.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_338">338</div>
<p>But the Professor&rsquo;s presence of mind did not
desert him. &ldquo;Undraw those curtains!&rdquo; he
shouted. It was done. The Monster gathered
its legs together, and in one tremendous bound
vanished into the sky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where <i>is</i> it?&rdquo; said the Emperor, rubbing
his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the next Province, I fancy,&rdquo; the Professor
replied. &ldquo;That jump would take it at
<i>least</i> five miles! The next thing is to explain
a Process or two. But I find there is
hardly room enough to operate&mdash;the smaller
animal is rather in my way&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who does he mean?&rdquo; Bruno whispered
to Sylvie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He means <i>you</i>!&rdquo; Sylvie whispered back.
&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be kind enough to move&mdash;angularly&mdash;to
<i>this</i> corner,&rdquo; the Professor said, addressing
himself to Bruno.</p>
<p>Bruno hastily moved his chair in the direction
indicated. &ldquo;Did I move angrily enough?&rdquo;
he inquired. But the Professor was once more
absorbed in his Lecture, which he was reading
from his note-book.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_339">339</div>
<p>&ldquo;I will now explain the Process of&mdash;the
name is blotted, I&rsquo;m sorry to say. It will
be illustrated by a number of&mdash;of&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; here
he examined the page for some time, and
at last said &ldquo;It seems to be either &lsquo;Experiments&rsquo;
or &lsquo;Specimens&rsquo;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let it be <i>Experiments</i>,&rdquo; said the Emperor.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve seen plenty of <i>Specimens</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly, certainly!&rdquo; the Professor assented.
&ldquo;We will have some Experiments.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May <i>I</i> do them?&rdquo; Bruno eagerly asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh dear no!&rdquo; The Professor looked dismayed.
&ldquo;I really don&rsquo;t know what would
happen if <i>you</i> did them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor nobody doosn&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;ll happen
if <i>oo</i> doos them!&rdquo; Bruno retorted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our First Experiment requires a Machine.
It has two knobs&mdash;only <i>two</i>&mdash;you can count
them, if you like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Head-Cook stepped forwards, counted
them, and retired satisfied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now you <i>might</i> press those two knobs together&mdash;but
that&rsquo;s not the way to do it. Or
you <i>might</i> turn the Machine upside-down&mdash;but
<i>that&rsquo;s</i> not the way to do it!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_340">340</div>
<p>&ldquo;What <i>are</i> the way to do it?&rdquo; said Bruno,
who was listening very attentively.</p>
<p>The Professor smiled benignantly. &ldquo;Ah,
yes!&rdquo; he said, in a voice like the heading of a
chapter. &ldquo;The Way To Do It! Permit me!&rdquo;
and in a moment he had whisked Bruno upon
the table. &ldquo;I divide my subject,&rdquo; he began,
&ldquo;into three parts&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll get down!&rdquo; Bruno whispered to
Sylvie. &ldquo;It aren&rsquo;t nice to be divided!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He hasn&rsquo;t got a knife, silly boy!&rdquo; Sylvie
whispered in reply. &ldquo;Stand still! You&rsquo;ll break
all the bottles!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The first part is to take hold of the knobs,&rdquo;
putting them into Bruno&rsquo;s hands. &ldquo;The second
part is&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Here he turned the handle, and,
with a loud &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;, Bruno dropped both the
knobs, and began rubbing his elbows.</p>
<p>The Professor chuckled in delight. &ldquo;It had
a sensible effect. <i>Hadn&rsquo;t</i> it?&rdquo; he enquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it hadn&rsquo;t a <i>sensible</i> effect!&rdquo; Bruno said
indignantly. &ldquo;It were very silly indeed. It
jingled my elbows, and it banged my back,
and it crinkled my hair, and it buzzed among
my bones!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_341">341</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure it <i>didn&rsquo;t</i>!&rdquo; said Sylvie. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
only inventing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oo doosn&rsquo;t know nuffin about it!&rdquo; Bruno
replied. &ldquo;Oo wasn&rsquo;t there to see. Nobody
ca&rsquo;n&rsquo;t go among my bones. There isn&rsquo;t room!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our Second Experiment,&rdquo; the Professor
announced, as Bruno returned to his place, still
thoughtfully rubbing his elbows, &ldquo;is the production
of that seldom-seen-but-greatly-to-be-admired
phenomenon, Black Light! You have
seen White Light, Red Light, Green Light, and
so on: but never, till this wonderful day, have
any eyes but mine seen <i>Black Light</i>! This
box,&rdquo; carefully lifting it upon the table, and
covering it with a heap of blankets, &ldquo;is quite
full of it. The way I made it was this&mdash;I
took a lighted candle into a dark cupboard and
shut the door. Of course the cupboard was
then full of <i>Yellow</i> Light. Then I took a bottle
of Black ink, and poured it over the candle:
and, to my delight, every atom of the Yellow
Light turned <i>Black</i>! That was indeed the
proudest moment of my life! Then I filled a
box with it. And now&mdash;would any one like
to get under the blankets and see it?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_342">342</div>
<p>Dead silence followed this appeal: but at last
Bruno said &ldquo;<i>I&rsquo;ll</i> get under, if it won&rsquo;t jingle
my elbows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Satisfied on this point, Bruno crawled under
the blankets, and, after a minute or two, crawled
out again, very hot and dusty, and with his hair
in the wildest confusion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you see in the box?&rdquo; Sylvie
eagerly enquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw <i>nuffin</i>!&rdquo; Bruno sadly replied. &ldquo;It
were too dark!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has described the appearance of the
thing exactly!&rdquo; the Professor exclaimed with
enthusiasm. &ldquo;Black Light, and Nothing, look
so extremely alike, at first sight, that I don&rsquo;t
wonder he failed to distinguish them! We will
now proceed to the Third Experiment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Professor came down, and led the way
to where a post had been driven firmly into
the ground. To one side of the post was
fastened a chain, with an iron weight hooked
on to the end of it, and from the other side
projected a piece of whalebone, with a ring
at the end of it. &ldquo;This is a <i>most</i> interesting
Experiment!&rdquo; the Professor announced. &ldquo;It
<span class="pb" id="Page_343">343</span>
will need <i>time</i>, I&rsquo;m afraid: but that is a trifling
disadvantage. Now observe. If I were to unhook
this weight, and let go, it would fall to the
ground. You do not deny <i>that</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nobody denied it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And in the same way, if I were to bend
this piece of whalebone round the post&mdash;thus&mdash;and
put the ring over this hook&mdash;thus&mdash;it
stays bent: but, if I unhook it, it straightens
itself again. You do not deny <i>that</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again, nobody denied it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, now, suppose we left things just as
they are, for a long time. The force of the
<i>whalebone</i> would get exhausted, you know, and
it would stay bent, even when you unhooked it.
Now, <i>why</i> shouldn&rsquo;t the same thing happen
with the <i>weight</i>? The <i>whalebone</i> gets so
used to being bent, that it ca&rsquo;n&rsquo;t <i>straighten</i>
itself any more. Why shouldn&rsquo;t the <i>weight</i>
get so used to being held up, that it ca&rsquo;n&rsquo;t <i>fall</i>
any more? That&rsquo;s what <i>I</i> want to know!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what <i>we</i> want to know!&rdquo; echoed
the crowd.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long must we wait?&rdquo; grumbled the
Emperor.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_344">344</div>
<p>The Professor looked at his watch. &ldquo;Well,
I <i>think</i> a thousand years will do to <i>begin</i> with,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;Then we will cautiously unhook
the weight: and, if it <i>still</i> shows (as perhaps
it will) a <i>slight</i> tendency to fall, we will hook
it on to the chain again, and leave it for
<i>another</i> thousand years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here the Empress experienced one of those
flashes of Common Sense which were the surprise
of all around her. &ldquo;Meanwhile there&rsquo;ll
be time for another Experiment,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There will <i>indeed</i>!&rdquo; cried the delighted
Professor. &ldquo;Let us return to the platform, and
proceed to the <i>Fourth</i> Experiment!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For this concluding Experiment, I will take
a certain Alkali, or Acid&mdash;I forget which.
Now you&rsquo;ll see what will happen when I mix
it with Some&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; here he took up a bottle,
and looked at it doubtfully, &ldquo;&mdash;when I mix
it with&mdash;with Something&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here the Emperor interrupted. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the
<i>name</i> of the stuff?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t remember the <i>name</i>,&rdquo; said the Professor:
&ldquo;and the label has come off.&rdquo; He
emptied it quickly into the other bottle, and,
<span class="pb" id="Page_345">345</span>
with a tremendous bang, both bottles flew to
pieces, upsetting all the machines, and filling
the Pavilion with thick black smoke. I sprang
to my feet in terror, and&mdash;and found myself
standing before my solitary hearth, where the
poker, dropping at last from the hand of the
sleeper, had knocked over the tongs and the
shovel, and had upset the kettle, filling the air
with clouds of steam. With a weary sigh, I
betook myself to bed.</p>

<br /><span class="small">THE BANQUET.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Heaviness may endure for a night: but joy
cometh in the morning.</i>&rdquo; The next day found
me quite another being. Even the memories of
my lost friend and companion were sunny as
the genial weather that smiled around me. I
did not venture to trouble Lady Muriel, or her
father, with another call so soon: but took a
walk into the country, and only turned homewards
when the low sunbeams warned me that
day would soon be over.</p>
<p>On my way home, I passed the cottage where
the old man lived, whose face always recalled
<span class="pb" id="Page_347">347</span>
to me the day when I first met Lady Muriel;
and I glanced in as I passed, half-curious to see
if he were still living there.</p>
<p>Yes: the old man was still alive. He was
sitting out in the porch, looking just as he did
when I first saw him at Fayfield Junction&mdash;it
seemed only a few days ago!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good evening!&rdquo; I said, pausing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good evening, Maister!&rdquo; he cheerfully
responded. &ldquo;Wo&rsquo;n&rsquo;t ee step in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I stepped in, and took a seat on the bench
in the porch. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to see you looking
so hearty,&rdquo; I began. &ldquo;Last time, I remember,
I chanced to pass just as Lady Muriel was
coming away from the house. Does she still
come to see you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ees,&rdquo; he answered slowly. &ldquo;She has na
forgotten me. I don&rsquo;t lose her bonny face for
many days together. Well I mind the very
first time she come, after we&rsquo;d met at Railway
Station. She told me as she come to mak&rsquo;
amends. Dear child! Only think o&rsquo; that!
To mak&rsquo; amends!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To make amends for what?&rdquo; I enquired.
&ldquo;What could <i>she</i> have done to need it?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_348">348</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it were loike this, you see? We were
both on us a-waiting fur t&rsquo; train at t&rsquo; Junction.
And I had setten mysen down upat t&rsquo; bench.
And Station-Maister, <i>he</i> comes and he orders
me off&mdash;fur t&rsquo; mak&rsquo; room for her Ladyship,
you understand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I remember it all,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I was there
myself, that day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Was</i> you, now? Well, an&rsquo; she axes my
pardon fur&rsquo;t. Think o&rsquo; that, now! <i>My</i> pardon!
An owd ne&rsquo;er-do-weel like me! Ah! She&rsquo;s
been here many a time, sin&rsquo; then. Why, she
were in here only yestere&rsquo;en, as it were, asittin&rsquo;,
as it might be, where you&rsquo;re a-sitting
now, an&rsquo; lookin&rsquo; sweeter and kinder nor an
angel! An&rsquo; she says &lsquo;You&rsquo;ve not got your
Minnie, now,&rsquo; she says, &lsquo;to fettle for ye.&rsquo;
Minnie was my grand-daughter, Sir, as lived
wi&rsquo; me. She died, a matter of two months
ago&mdash;or it may be three. She was a bonny
lass&mdash;and a good lass, too. Eh, but life has
been rare an&rsquo; lonely without her!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He covered his face in his hands: and I
waited a minute or two, in silence, for him to
recover himself.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_349">349</div>
<p>&ldquo;So she says &lsquo;Just tak&rsquo; <i>me</i> fur your Minnie!&rsquo;
she says. &lsquo;Didna Minnie mak&rsquo; your tea fur
you?&rsquo; says she. &lsquo;Ay,&rsquo; says I. An she mak&rsquo;s
the tea. &lsquo;An&rsquo; didna Minnie light your pipe?&rsquo;
says she. &lsquo;Ay,&rsquo; says I. An&rsquo; she lights the
pipe for me. &lsquo;An&rsquo; didna Minnie set out your
tea in t&rsquo; porch?&rsquo; An&rsquo; I says &lsquo;My dear,&rsquo; I
says, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m thinking you&rsquo;re Minnie hersen!&rsquo;
An&rsquo; she cries a bit. We both on us cries a
bit&mdash;&mdash;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again I kept silence for a while.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; while I smokes my pipe, she sits an&rsquo;
talks to me&mdash;as loving an&rsquo; as pleasant! I&rsquo;ll
be bound I thowt it were Minnie come again!
An&rsquo; when she gets up to go, I says &lsquo;Winnot ye
shak&rsquo; hands wi&rsquo; me?&rsquo; says I. An&rsquo; she says
&lsquo;Na,&rsquo; she says: &lsquo;a cannot <i>shak&rsquo; hands</i> wi&rsquo;
thee!&rsquo; she says.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry she said <i>that</i>,&rdquo; I put in, thinking
it was the only instance I had ever known of
pride of rank showing itself in Lady Muriel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bless you, it werena <i>pride</i>!&rdquo; said the
old man, reading my thoughts. &ldquo;She says
&lsquo;<i>Your</i> Minnie never <i>shook hands</i> wi&rsquo; you!&rsquo; she
says. &lsquo;An&rsquo; <i>I&rsquo;m</i> your Minnie now,&rsquo; she says.
<span class="pb" id="Page_350">350</span>
An&rsquo; she just puts her dear arms about my
neck&mdash;and she kisses me on t&rsquo; cheek&mdash;an&rsquo;
may God in Heaven bless her!&rdquo; And here
the poor old man broke down entirely, and
could say no more.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig33">
<img src="images/i350.jpg" alt="&lsquo;A CANNOT SHAK&rsquo; HANDS WI&rsquo; THEE!&rsquo;" width="500" height="708" />
<p class="center small">&lsquo;A CANNOT SHAK&rsquo; HANDS WI&rsquo; THEE!&rsquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;God bless her!&rdquo; I echoed. &ldquo;And good
night to you!&rdquo; I pressed his hand, and left
<span class="pb" id="Page_351">351</span>
him. &ldquo;Lady Muriel,&rdquo; I said softly to myself
as I went homewards, &ldquo;truly you know how
to &lsquo;mak&rsquo; amends&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Seated once more by my lonely fireside, I
tried to recall the strange vision of the night
before, and to conjure up the face of the dear
old Professor among the blazing coals. &ldquo;That
black one&mdash;with just a touch of red&mdash;would
suit him well,&rdquo; I thought. &ldquo;After such a catastrophe,
it would be sure to be covered with
black stains&mdash;and he would say:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The result of <i>that</i> combination&mdash;you may
have noticed?&mdash;was an <i>Explosion</i>! Shall I
repeat the Experiment?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no! Don&rsquo;t trouble yourself!&rdquo; was the
general cry. And we all trooped off, in hot
haste, to the Banqueting-Hall, where the feast
had already begun.</p>
<p>No time was lost in helping the dishes, and
very speedily every guest found his plate filled
with good things.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have always maintained the principle,&rdquo;
the Professor began, &ldquo;that it is a good rule
to take some food&mdash;occasionally. The great
advantage of dinner-parties&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; he broke off
suddenly. &ldquo;Why, actually here&rsquo;s the Other
Professor!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;And there&rsquo;s no place
left for him!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="center small">THE OTHER PROFESSOR&rsquo;S FALL</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_353">353</div>
<p>The Other Professor came in reading a large
book, which he held close to his eyes. One
result of his not looking where he was going
was that he tripped up, as he crossed the
Saloon, flew up into the air, and fell heavily
on his face in the middle of the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>What</i> a pity!&rdquo; cried the kind-hearted Professor,
as he helped him up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t be <i>me</i>, if I didn&rsquo;t trip,&rdquo; said the
Other Professor.</p>
<p>The Professor looked much shocked. &ldquo;Almost
<i>anything</i> would be better than <i>that</i>!&rdquo; he
exclaimed. &ldquo;It never does,&rdquo; he added, aside
to Bruno, &ldquo;to be anybody else, does it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>To which Bruno gravely replied &ldquo;I&rsquo;s got
nuffin on my plate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Professor hastily put on his spectacles,
to make sure that the <i>facts</i> were all right, to
begin with: then he turned his jolly round
face upon the unfortunate owner of the empty
plate. &ldquo;And what would you like next,
my little man?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_354">354</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Bruno said, a little doubtfully, &ldquo;I
think I&rsquo;ll take some plum-pudding, please&mdash;while
I think of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Bruno!&rdquo; (This was a whisper from
Sylvie.) &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t good manners to ask for a
dish before it comes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Bruno whispered back &ldquo;But I might forget
to ask for some, when it comes, oo know&mdash;I
<i>do</i> forget things, sometimes,&rdquo; he added,
seeing Sylvie about to whisper more.</p>
<p>And <i>this</i> assertion Sylvie did not venture to
contradict.</p>
<p>Meanwhile a chair had been placed for the
Other Professor, between the Empress and
Sylvie. Sylvie found him a rather uninteresting
neighbour: in fact, she couldn&rsquo;t afterwards
remember that he had made more than <i>one</i>
remark to her during the whole banquet, and
that was &ldquo;What a comfort a Dictionary is!&rdquo;
(She told Bruno, afterwards, that she had been
too much afraid of him to say more than &ldquo;Yes,
Sir,&rdquo; in reply; and that had been the end of
their conversation. On which Bruno expressed
a very decided opinion that <i>that</i> wasn&rsquo;t worth
calling a &lsquo;conversation&rsquo; at all. &ldquo;Oo should
<span class="pb" id="Page_355">355</span>
have asked him a riddle!&rdquo; he added triumphantly.
&ldquo;Why, <i>I</i> asked the Professor <i>three</i>
riddles! One was that one you asked me in
the morning, &lsquo;How many pennies is there in
two shillings?&rsquo; And another was&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh,
Bruno!&rdquo; Sylvie interrupted. &ldquo;<i>That</i> wasn&rsquo;t a
riddle!&rdquo; &ldquo;It <i>were</i>!&rdquo; Bruno fiercely replied.)</p>
<p>By this time a waiter had supplied Bruno
with a plateful of <i>something</i>, which drove the
plum-pudding out of his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another advantage of dinner-parties,&rdquo; the
Professor cheerfully explained, for the benefit
of any one that would listen, &ldquo;is that it helps
you to <i>see</i> your friends. If you want to <i>see</i> a
man, offer him something to eat. It&rsquo;s the same
rule with a mouse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This Cat&rsquo;s very kind to the Mouses,&rdquo; Bruno
said, stooping to stroke a remarkably fat specimen
of the race, that had just waddled into the
room, and was rubbing itself affectionately
against the leg of his chair. &ldquo;Please, Sylvie,
pour some milk in your saucer. Pussie&rsquo;s ever
so thirsty!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you want <i>my</i> saucer?&rdquo; said Sylvie.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got one yourself!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_356">356</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know,&rdquo; said Bruno: &ldquo;but I wanted
<i>mine</i> for to give it some <i>more</i> milk in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sylvie looked unconvinced: however it
seemed quite impossible for her <i>ever</i> to refuse
what her brother asked: so she quietly filled
her saucer with milk, and handed it to Bruno,
who got down off his chair to administer it to
the cat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The room&rsquo;s very hot, with all this crowd,&rdquo;
the Professor said to Sylvie. &ldquo;I wonder why
they don&rsquo;t put some lumps of ice in the grate?
You fill it with lumps of coal in the winter, you
know, and you sit round it and enjoy the
warmth. How jolly it would be to fill it now
with lumps of ice, and sit round it and enjoy
the coolth!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hot as it was, Sylvie shivered a little at the
idea. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very cold <i>outside</i>,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;My
feet got almost frozen to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the <i>shoemaker&rsquo;s</i> fault!&rdquo; the Professor
cheerfully replied. &ldquo;How often I&rsquo;ve
explained to him that he <i>ought</i> to make boots
with little iron frames under the soles, to hold
lamps! But he never <i>thinks</i>. No one would
suffer from cold, if only they would <i>think</i> of
<span class="pb" id="Page_357">357</span>
those little things. I always use hot ink, myself,
in the winter. Very few people ever think
of <i>that</i>! Yet how simple it is!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s very simple,&rdquo; Sylvie said politely.
&ldquo;Has the cat had enough?&rdquo; This was to
Bruno, who had brought back the saucer only
half-emptied.</p>
<p>But Bruno did not hear the question.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s somebody scratching at the door
and wanting to come in,&rdquo; he said. And he
scrambled down off his chair, and went and
cautiously peeped out through the door-way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who was it wanted to come in?&rdquo; Sylvie
asked, as he returned to his place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It were a Mouse,&rdquo; said Bruno. &ldquo;And it
peepted in. And it saw the Cat. And it said
&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll come in another day.&rsquo; And I said &lsquo;Oo
needn&rsquo;t be flightened. The Cat&rsquo;s <i>welly</i> kind
to Mouses.&rsquo; And it said &lsquo;But I&rsquo;s got some
imporkant business, what I <i>must</i> attend to.&rsquo;
And it said &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll call again to-morrow.&rsquo; And it
said &lsquo;Give my love to the Cat.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a fat cat it is!&rdquo; said the Lord Chancellor,
leaning across the Professor to address
his small neighbour. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s quite a wonder!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_358">358</div>
<p>&ldquo;It was awfully fat when it camed in,&rdquo; said
Bruno: &ldquo;so it would be more wonderfuller if
it got thin all in a minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that was the reason, I suppose,&rdquo; the
Lord Chancellor suggested, &ldquo;why you didn&rsquo;t
give it the rest of the milk?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Bruno. &ldquo;It were a betterer
reason. I tooked the saucer up &rsquo;cause it were
so discontented!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t look so to <i>me</i>,&rdquo; said the Lord
Chancellor. &ldquo;What made you think it was
discontented?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Cause it grumbled in its throat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Bruno!&rdquo; cried Sylvie. &ldquo;Why, that&rsquo;s
the way cats show they&rsquo;re <i>pleased</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bruno looked doubtful. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a good
way,&rdquo; he objected. &ldquo;Oo wouldn&rsquo;t say <i>I</i> were
pleased, if I made that noise in my throat!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a singular boy!&rdquo; the Lord Chancellor
whispered to himself: but Bruno had
caught the words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do it mean to say &lsquo;a <i>singular</i> boy&rsquo;?&rdquo;
he whispered to Sylvie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It means <i>one</i> boy,&rdquo; Sylvie whispered in
return. &ldquo;And <i>plural</i> means two or three.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_359">359</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;s welly glad I <i>is</i> a singular boy!&rdquo;
Bruno said with great emphasis. &ldquo;It would be
<i>horrid</i> to be two or three boys! P&rsquo;raps they
wouldn&rsquo;t play with me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why <i>should</i> they?&rdquo; said the Other Professor,
suddenly waking up out of a deep
reverie. &ldquo;They might be asleep, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t, if <i>I</i> was awake,&rdquo; Bruno said
cunningly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but they might indeed!&rdquo; the Other
Professor protested. &ldquo;Boys don&rsquo;t all go to
sleep at once, you know. So these boys&mdash;but
who are you talking about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He <i>never</i> remembers to ask that first!&rdquo; the
Professor whispered to the children.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, the rest of <i>me</i>, a-course!&rdquo; Bruno
exclaimed triumphantly. &ldquo;Supposing I was
two or three boys!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Other Professor sighed, and seemed to
be sinking back into his reverie; but suddenly
brightened up again, and addressed the Professor.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing more to be done
<i>now</i>, is there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, there&rsquo;s the dinner to finish,&rdquo; the Professor
said with a bewildered smile: &ldquo;and the
<span class="pb" id="Page_360">360</span>
heat to bear. I hope you&rsquo;ll enjoy the dinner&mdash;such
as it is; and that you won&rsquo;t mind the
heat&mdash;such as it isn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sentence <i>sounded</i> well, but somehow I
couldn&rsquo;t quite understand it; and the Other
Professor seemed to be no better off. &ldquo;Such
as it isn&rsquo;t <i>what</i>?&rdquo; he peevishly enquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t as hot as it might be,&rdquo; the Professor
replied, catching at the first idea that
came to hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, I see what you mean <i>now</i>!&rdquo; the Other
Professor graciously remarked. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very
badly expressed, but I quite see it <i>now</i>! Thirteen
minutes and a half ago,&rdquo; he went on,
looking first at Bruno and then at his watch
as he spoke, &ldquo;you said &lsquo;this Cat&rsquo;s very kind to
the Mouses.&rsquo; It must be a singular animal!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So it <i>are</i>,&rdquo; said Bruno, after carefully examining
the Cat, to make sure how many there
were of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how do you know it&rsquo;s kind to the
Mouses&mdash;or, more correctly speaking, the
<i>Mice</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Cause it <i>plays</i> with the Mouses,&rdquo; said Bruno;
&ldquo;for to amuse them, oo know.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_361">361</div>
<p>&ldquo;But that is just what I <i>don&rsquo;t</i> know,&rdquo; the
Other Professor rejoined. &ldquo;My belief is, it
plays with them to <i>kill</i> them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s quite a <i>accident</i>!&rdquo; Bruno began,
so eagerly, that it was evident he had already
propounded this very difficulty to the Cat.
&ldquo;It &rsquo;splained all that to me, while it were
drinking the milk. It said &lsquo;I teaches the
Mouses new games: the Mouses likes it ever
so much.&rsquo; It said &lsquo;Sometimes little accidents
happens: sometimes the Mouses kills theirselves.&rsquo;
It said &lsquo;I&rsquo;s always <i>welly</i> sorry, when
the Mouses kills theirselves.&rsquo; It said&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it was so <i>very</i> sorry,&rdquo; Sylvie said, rather
disdainfully, &ldquo;it wouldn&rsquo;t <i>eat</i> the Mouses after
they&rsquo;d killed themselves!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But this difficulty, also, had evidently not
been lost sight of in the exhaustive ethical discussion
just concluded. &ldquo;It said&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; (the
orator constantly omitted, as superfluous, his
own share in the dialogue, and merely gave us
the replies of the Cat) &ldquo;It said &lsquo;Dead Mouses
<i>never</i> objecks to be eaten.&rsquo; It said &lsquo;There&rsquo;s no
use wasting good Mouses.&rsquo; It said &lsquo;Wifful&mdash;&rsquo;
sumfinoruvver. It said &lsquo;And oo may live to
<span class="pb" id="Page_362">362</span>
say &lsquo;How much I wiss I had the Mouse that
then I frew away!&rsquo; It said&mdash;&mdash;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It hadn&rsquo;t <i>time</i> to say such a lot of things!&rdquo;
Sylvie interrupted indignantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oo doosn&rsquo;t know how Cats speaks!&rdquo; Bruno
rejoined contemptuously. &ldquo;Cats speaks <i>welly</i>
quick!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_363">363</div>
<h2 id="c23">CHAPTER XXIII.
<br /><span class="small">THE PIG-TALE.</span></h2>
<p>By this time the appetites of the guests
seemed to be nearly satisfied, and even <i>Bruno</i>
had the resolution to say, when the Professor
offered him a fourth slice of plum-pudding,
&ldquo;I thinks three helpings is enough!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly the Professor started as if he had
been electrified. &ldquo;Why, I had nearly forgotten
the most important part of the entertainment!
The Other Professor is to recite a
Tale of a Pig&mdash;I mean a Pig-Tale,&rdquo; he corrected
himself. &ldquo;It has Introductory Verses
at the beginning, and at the end.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_364">364</div>
<p>&ldquo;It ca&rsquo;n&rsquo;t have Introductory Verses at the
<i>end</i>, can it?&rdquo; said Sylvie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait till you hear it,&rdquo; said the Professor:
&ldquo;then you&rsquo;ll see. I&rsquo;m not sure it hasn&rsquo;t some
in the <i>middle</i>, as well.&rdquo; Here he rose to his
feet, and there was an instant silence through
the Banqueting-Hall: they evidently expected
a speech.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ladies, and gentlemen,&rdquo; the Professor
began, &ldquo;the Other Professor is so kind as to
recite a Poem. The title of it is &lsquo;The Pig-Tale.&rsquo;
He never recited it before!&rdquo; (General
cheering among the guests.) &ldquo;He will never
recite it again!&rdquo; (Frantic excitement, and wild
cheering all down the hall, the Professor himself
mounting the table in hot haste, to lead the
cheering, and waving his spectacles in one hand
and a spoon in the other.)</p>
<p>Then the Other Professor got up, and
began:&mdash;</p>

<p>When the Other Professor had recited this

put his head up the chimney. In doing this,
he lost his balance, and fell head-first into the
empty grate, and got so firmly fixed there
that it was some time before he could be
dragged out again.</p>
<p>Bruno had had time to say &ldquo;I thought he
wanted to see how many peoples was up

<p>And Sylvie had said &ldquo;<i>Chimney</i>&mdash;not

Empress said anxiously. &ldquo;Let me send for

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a miserable story!&rdquo; said Bruno. &ldquo;It
begins miserably, and it ends miserablier. I
think I shall cry. Sylvie, please lend me your
handkerchief.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_374">374</div>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t got it with me,&rdquo; Sylvie whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I won&rsquo;t cry,&rdquo; said Bruno manfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are more Introductory Verses to
come,&rdquo; said the Other Professor, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m
hungry.&rdquo; He sat down, cut a large slice
of cake, put it on Bruno&rsquo;s plate, and gazed
at his own empty plate in astonishment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did you get that cake?&rdquo; Sylvie
whispered to Bruno.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He gived it me,&rdquo; said Bruno.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you shouldn&rsquo;t ask for things! You
<i>know</i> you shouldn&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I <i>didn&rsquo;t</i> ask,&rdquo; said Bruno, taking a fresh
mouthful: &ldquo;he <i>gived</i> it me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sylvie considered this for a moment: then
she saw her way out of it. &ldquo;Well, then, ask
him to give <i>me</i> some!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You seem to enjoy that cake?&rdquo; the Professor
remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doos that mean &lsquo;munch&rsquo;?&rdquo; Bruno whispered
to Sylvie.</p>
<p>Sylvie nodded. &ldquo;It means &lsquo;to munch&rsquo; and
&lsquo;to <i>like</i> to munch.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bruno smiled at the Professor. &ldquo;I <i>doos</i>
enjoy it,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_375">375</div>
<p>The Other Professor caught the word. &ldquo;And
I hope you&rsquo;re enjoying <i>yourself</i>, little Man?&rdquo;
he enquired.</p>
<p>Bruno&rsquo;s look of horror quite startled him.
&ldquo;No, <i>indeed</i> I aren&rsquo;t!&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>The Other Professor looked thoroughly
puzzled. &ldquo;Well, well!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Try some
cowslip wine!&rdquo; And he filled a glass and
handed it to Bruno. &ldquo;Drink this, my dear,
and you&rsquo;ll be quite another man!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who shall I be?&rdquo; said Bruno, pausing in
the act of putting it to his lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ask so many questions!&rdquo; Sylvie
interposed, anxious to save the poor old man
from further bewilderment. &ldquo;Suppose we get
the Professor to tell us a story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bruno adopted the idea with enthusiasm.
&ldquo;<i>Please</i> do!&rdquo; he cried eagerly. &ldquo;Sumfin
about tigers&mdash;and bumble-bees&mdash;and robin-redbreasts,
oo knows!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why should you always have <i>live</i> things
in stories?&rdquo; said the Professor. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t
you have events, or circumstances?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, <i>please</i> invent a story like that!&rdquo; cried
Bruno.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_376">376</div>
<p>The Professor began fluently enough. &ldquo;Once
a coincidence was taking a walk with a little
accident, and they met an explanation&mdash;a <i>very</i>
old explanation&mdash;so old that it was quite
doubled up, and looked more like a conundrum&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
he broke off suddenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Please</i> go on!&rdquo; both children exclaimed.</p>
<p>The Professor made a candid confession.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a very difficult sort to invent, I find.
Suppose Bruno tells one, first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bruno was only too happy to adopt the
suggestion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Once there were a Pig, and a Accordion,
and two Jars of Orange-marmalade&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The <i>dramatis person&aelig;</i>,&rdquo; murmured the
Professor. &ldquo;Well, what then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So, when the Pig played on the Accordion,&rdquo;
Bruno went on, &ldquo;one of the Jars of Orange-marmalade
didn&rsquo;t like the tune, and the other
Jar of Orange-marmalade did like the tune&mdash;I
<i>know</i> I shall get confused among those Jars
of Orange-marmalade, Sylvie!&rdquo; he whispered
anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will now recite the other Introductory
Verses,&rdquo; said the Other Professor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The next thing to be done,&rdquo; the Professor
cheerfully remarked to the Lord Chancellor,
as soon as the applause, caused by the recital
of the Pig-Tale, had come to an end, &ldquo;is to
drink the Emperor&rsquo;s health, is it not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Undoubtedly!&rdquo; the Lord Chancellor replied
with much solemnity, as he rose to his
feet to give the necessary directions for the
ceremony. &ldquo;Fill your glasses!&rdquo; he thundered.
All did so, instantly. &ldquo;Drink the Emperor&rsquo;s
health!&rdquo; A general gurgling resounded all
through the Hall. &ldquo;Three cheers for the
Emperor!&rdquo; The faintest possible sound followed
<i>this</i> announcement: and the Chancellor,
with admirable presence of mind, instantly
proclaimed &ldquo;A speech from the Emperor!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Emperor had begun his speech almost
before the words were uttered. &ldquo;However
unwilling to be Emperor&mdash;since you all wish
me to be Emperor&mdash;you know how badly
the late Warden managed things&mdash;with such
enthusiasm as you have shown&mdash;he persecuted
you&mdash;he taxed you too heavily&mdash;you
know who is fittest man to be Emperor&mdash;my
brother had no sense&mdash;&mdash;.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_379">379</div>
<p>How long this curious speech might have
lasted it is impossible to say, for just at this
moment a hurricane shook the palace to its
foundations, bursting open the windows, extinguishing
some of the lamps, and filling the air
with clouds of dust, which took strange shapes
in the air, and seemed to form words.</p>
<p>But the storm subsided as suddenly as it had
risen&mdash;the casements swung into their places
again: the dust vanished: all was as it had
been a minute ago&mdash;with the exception of
the Emperor and Empress, over whom had
come a wondrous change. The vacant stare,
the meaningless smile, had passed away: all
could see that these two strange beings had
returned to their senses.</p>
<p>The Emperor continued his speech as if
there had been no interruption. &ldquo;And we have
behaved&mdash;my wife and I&mdash;like two arrant
Knaves. We deserve no better name. When
my brother went away, you lost the best Warden
you ever had. And I&rsquo;ve been doing my
best, wretched hypocrite that I am, to cheat you
into making me an Emperor. Me! One that
has hardly got the wits to be a shoe-black!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_380">380</div>
<p>The Lord Chancellor wrung his hands in
despair. &ldquo;He is mad, good people!&rdquo; he was
beginning. But both speeches stopped suddenly&mdash;and,
in the dead silence that followed,
a knocking was heard at the outer door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; was the general cry. People
began running in and out. The excitement
increased every moment. The Lord Chancellor,
forgetting all the rules of Court-ceremony, ran
full speed down the hall, and in a minute
returned, pale and gasping for breath.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_381">381</div>
<h2 id="c24">CHAPTER XXIV.
<br /><span class="small">THE BEGGAR&rsquo;S RETURN.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Your Imperial Highnesses!&rdquo; he began.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the old Beggar again! Shall we set the
dogs at him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bring him here!&rdquo; said the Emperor.</p>
<p>The Chancellor could scarcely believe his
ears. &ldquo;<i>Here</i>, your Imperial Highness? Did
I rightly understand&mdash;&mdash;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bring him here!&rdquo; the Emperor thundered
once more. The Chancellor tottered down
the hall&mdash;and in another minute the crowd
divided, and the poor old Beggar was seen
entering the Banqueting-Hall.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_382">382</div>
<div class="img" id="fig42">

<p class="center small">THE OLD BEGGAR&rsquo;S RETURN</p>
</div>
<p>He was indeed a pitiable object: the rags,
that hung about him, were all splashed with
mud: his white hair and his long beard were
tossed about in wild disorder. Yet he walked
upright, with a stately tread, as if used to command:
and&mdash;strangest sight of all&mdash;Sylvie
and Bruno came with him, clinging to his hands,
and gazing at him with looks of silent love.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_383">383</div>
<p>Men looked eagerly to see how the Emperor
would receive the bold intruder. Would
he hurl him from the steps of the da&iuml;s? But
no. To their utter astonishment, the Emperor
knelt as the beggar approached, and with
bowed head murmured &ldquo;Forgive us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forgive us!&rdquo; the Empress, kneeling at her
husband&rsquo;s side, meekly repeated.</p>
<p>The Outcast smiled. &ldquo;Rise up!&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;I forgive you!&rdquo; And men saw with wonder
that a change had passed over the old beggar,
even as he spoke. What had seemed, but now,
to be vile rags and splashes of mud, were seen
to be in truth kingly trappings, broidered with
gold, and sparkling with gems. All knew him
now, and bent low before the Elder Brother, the
true Warden.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brother mine, and Sister mine!&rdquo; the Warden
began, in a clear voice that was heard all
through that vast hall. &ldquo;I come not to disturb
you. Rule on, as Emperor, and rule wisely.
For I am chosen King of Elfland. To-morrow
I return there, taking nought from hence, save
only&mdash;save only&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; his voice trembled, and
with a look of ineffable tenderness, he laid
<span class="pb" id="Page_384">384</span>
his hands in silence on the heads of the two
little ones who clung around him.</p>
<p>But he recovered himself in a moment, and
beckoned to the Emperor to resume his place
at the table. The company seated themselves
again&mdash;room being found for the Elfin-King
between his two children&mdash;and the Lord
Chancellor rose once more, to propose the
next toast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The next toast&mdash;the hero of the day&mdash;why,
he isn&rsquo;t here!&rdquo; he broke off in wild
confusion.</p>
<p>Good gracious! Everybody had forgotten
Prince Uggug!</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was told of the Banquet, of course?&rdquo;
said the Emperor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Undoubtedly!&rdquo; replied the Chancellor.
&ldquo;<i>That</i> would be the duty of the Gold Stick
in Waiting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let the Gold Stick come forwards!&rdquo; the
Emperor gravely said.</p>
<p>The Gold Stick came forwards. &ldquo;I attended
on His Imperial Fatness,&rdquo; was the statement
made by the trembling official. &ldquo;I told him
of the Lecture and the Banquet&mdash;&mdash;.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_385">385</div>
<p>&ldquo;What followed?&rdquo; said the Emperor: for
the unhappy man seemed almost too frightened
to go on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;His Imperial Fatness was graciously pleased
to be sulky. His Imperial Fatness was graciously
pleased to box my ears. His Imperial
Fatness was graciously pleased to say &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t
care!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t-care&rsquo; came to a bad end,&rdquo; Sylvie
whispered to Bruno. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure, but I
<i>believe</i> he was hanged.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Professor overheard her. &ldquo;<i>That</i> result,&rdquo;
he blandly remarked, &ldquo;was merely a case of
mistaken identity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both children looked puzzled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Permit me to explain. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t-care&rsquo; and
&lsquo;Care&rsquo; were twin-brothers. &lsquo;Care,&rsquo; you know,
killed the Cat. And they caught &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t-care&rsquo;
by mistake, and hanged him instead. And so
&lsquo;Care&rsquo; is alive still. But he&rsquo;s very unhappy
without his brother. That&rsquo;s why they say
&lsquo;Begone, dull Care!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you!&rdquo; Sylvie said, heartily. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
very extremely interesting. Why, it seems to
explain <i>everything</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_386">386</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, not quite <i>everything</i>,&rdquo; the Professor
modestly rejoined. &ldquo;There are two or three
scientific difficulties&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was your general impression as to
His Imperial Fatness?&rdquo; the Emperor asked
the Gold Stick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My impression was that His Imperial Fatness
was getting more&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;More <i>what</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>All listened breathlessly for the next word.</p>
<p>&ldquo;More <span class="small">PRICKLY</span>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He must be sent for <i>at once</i>!&rdquo; the Emperor
exclaimed. And the Gold Stick went off
like a shot. The Elfin-King sadly shook his
head. &ldquo;No use, no use!&rdquo; he murmured to
himself. &ldquo;Loveless, loveless!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pale, trembling, speechless, the Gold Stick
came slowly back again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; said the Emperor. &ldquo;Why does
not the Prince appear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One can easily guess,&rdquo; said the Professor.
&ldquo;His Imperial Fatness is, without doubt, a
little preoccupied.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bruno turned a look of solemn enquiry on
his old friend. &ldquo;What do that word mean?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_387">387</div>
<p>But the Professor took no notice of the question.
He was eagerly listening to the Gold
Stick&rsquo;s reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please your Highness! His Imperial Fatness
is&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Not a word more could he utter.</p>
<p>The Empress rose in an agony of alarm.
&ldquo;Let us go to him!&rdquo; she cried. And there
was a general rush for the door.</p>
<p>Bruno slipped off his chair in a moment.
&ldquo;May we go too?&rdquo; he eagerly asked. But
the King did not hear the question, as the
Professor was speaking to him. &ldquo;<i>Preoccupied</i>,
your Majesty!&rdquo; he was saying. &ldquo;That is
what he is, no doubt!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May we go and see him?&rdquo; Bruno repeated.
The King nodded assent, and the children ran
off. In a minute or two they returned, slowly
and gravely. &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; said the King. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s
the matter with the Prince?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s&mdash;what <i>you</i> said,&rdquo; Bruno replied,
looking at the Professor. &ldquo;That hard word.&rdquo;
And he looked to Sylvie for assistance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Porcupine,&rdquo; said Sylvie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; the Professor corrected her.
&ldquo;&lsquo;<i>Pre-occupied</i>,&rsquo; you mean.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_388">388</div>
<div class="img" id="fig43">
<img src="images/i388.jpg" alt="&lsquo;PORCUPINE!&rsquo;" width="769" height="500" />
<p class="center small">&lsquo;PORCUPINE!&rsquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_389">389</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s <i>porcupine</i>,&rdquo; persisted Sylvie. &ldquo;Not
that other word at all. And please will you
come? The house is all in an uproar.&rdquo; (&ldquo;And
oo&rsquo;d better bring an uproar-glass wiz oo!&rdquo;
added Bruno.)</p>
<p>We got up in great haste, and followed the
children upstairs. No one took the least notice
of <i>me</i>, but I wasn&rsquo;t at all surprised at this, as I
had long realised that I was quite invisible to
them all&mdash;even to Sylvie and Bruno.</p>
<p>All along the gallery, that led to the Prince&rsquo;s
apartment, an excited crowd was surging to and
fro, and the Babel of voices was deafening:
against the door of the room three strong men
were leaning, vainly trying to shut it&mdash;for some
great animal inside was constantly bursting it
half open, and we had a glimpse, before the men
could push it back again, of the head of a furious
wild beast, with great fiery eyes and gnashing
teeth. Its voice was a sort of mixture&mdash;there
was the roaring of a lion, and the bellowing of a
bull, and now and then a scream like a gigantic
parrot. &ldquo;There is no judging by the voice!&rdquo;
the Professor cried in great excitement. &ldquo;What
is it?&rdquo; he shouted to the men at the door.
<span class="pb" id="Page_390">390</span>
And a general chorus of voices answered him
&ldquo;Porcupine! Prince Uggug has turned into
a Porcupine!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A new Specimen!&rdquo; exclaimed the delighted
Professor. &ldquo;Pray let me go in. It should be
labeled at once!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the strong men only pushed him back.
&ldquo;Label it, indeed! Do you want to be eaten
up?&rdquo; they cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind about Specimens, Professor!&rdquo;
said the Emperor, pushing his way through the
crowd. &ldquo;Tell us how to keep him safe!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A large cage!&rdquo; the Professor promptly replied.
&ldquo;Bring a large cage,&rdquo; he said to the
people generally, &ldquo;with strong bars of steel,
and a portcullis made to go up and down like
a mouse-trap! Does any one happen to have
such a thing about him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t sound a likely sort of thing for any
one to have about him; however, they brought
him one directly: curiously enough, there happened
to be one standing in the gallery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Put it facing the opening of the door, and
draw up the portcullis!&rdquo; This was done in a
moment.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_391">391</div>
<p>&ldquo;Blankets now!&rdquo; cried the Professor. &ldquo;This
is a most interesting Experiment!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There happened to be a pile of blankets
close by: and the Professor had hardly said the
word, when they were all unfolded and held up
like curtains all around. The Professor rapidly
arranged them in two rows, so as to make a
dark passage, leading straight from the door to
the mouth of the cage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now fling the door open!&rdquo; This did not
need to be done: the three men had only to
leap out of the way, and the fearful monster
flung the door open for itself, and, with a yell
like the whistle of a steam-engine, rushed into
the cage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Down with the portcullis!&rdquo; No sooner
said than done: and all breathed freely once
more, on seeing the Porcupine safely caged.</p>
<p>The Professor rubbed his hands in childish
delight. &ldquo;The Experiment has succeeded!&rdquo; he
proclaimed. &ldquo;All that is needed now is to
feed it three times a day, on chopped carrots
and&mdash;&mdash;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind about its food, just now!&rdquo;
the Emperor interrupted. &ldquo;Let us return to
<span class="pb" id="Page_392">392</span>
the Banquet. Brother, will you lead the way?&rdquo;
And the old man, attended by his children,
headed the procession down stairs. &ldquo;See the
fate of a loveless life!&rdquo; he said to Bruno, as
they returned to their places. To which
Bruno made reply, &ldquo;I always loved Sylvie,
so I&rsquo;ll never get prickly like that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He <i>is</i> prickly, certainly,&rdquo; said the Professor,
who had caught the last words, &ldquo;but we must
remember that, however porcupiny, he is royal
still! After this feast is over, I&rsquo;m going to
take a little present to Prince Uggug&mdash;just
to soothe him, you know: it isn&rsquo;t pleasant
living in a cage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;ll you give him for a birthday-present?&rdquo;
Bruno enquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A small saucer of chopped carrots,&rdquo; replied
the Professor. &ldquo;In giving birthday-presents,
<i>my</i> motto is&mdash;cheapness! I should think I
save forty pounds a year by giving&mdash;oh, <i>what</i>
a twinge of pain!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; said Sylvie anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My old enemy!&rdquo; groaned the Professor.
&ldquo;Lumbago&mdash;rheumatism&mdash;that sort of thing.
I think I&rsquo;ll go and lie down a bit.&rdquo; And he
<span class="pb" id="Page_393">393</span>
hobbled out of the Saloon, watched by the
pitying eyes of the two children.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be better soon!&rdquo; the Elfin-King said
cheerily. &ldquo;Brother!&rdquo; turning to the Emperor,
&ldquo;I have some business to arrange with you
to-night. The Empress will take care of the
children.&rdquo; And the two Brothers went away
together, arm-in-arm.</p>
<p>The Empress found the children rather sad
company. They could talk of nothing but
&ldquo;the dear Professor,&rdquo; and &ldquo;what a pity he&rsquo;s
so ill!&rdquo;, till at last she made the welcome
proposal &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go and see him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The children eagerly grasped the hands she
offered them: and we went off to the Professor&rsquo;s
study, and found him lying on the sofa,
covered up with blankets, and reading a little
manuscript-book. &ldquo;Notes on Vol. Three!&rdquo; he
murmured, looking up at us. And there, on a
table near him, lay the book he was seeking
when first I saw him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how are you now, Professor?&rdquo; the
Empress asked, bending over the invalid.</p>
<p>The Professor looked up, and smiled feebly.
&ldquo;As devoted to your Imperial Highness as
<span class="pb" id="Page_394">394</span>
ever!&rdquo; he said in a weak voice. &ldquo;All of me,
that is not Lumbago, is Loyalty!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A sweet sentiment!&rdquo; the Empress exclaimed
with tears in her eyes. &ldquo;You seldom
hear anything so beautiful as that&mdash;even in
a Valentine!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must take you to stay at the seaside,&rdquo;
Sylvie said, tenderly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll do you ever so
much good! And the Sea&rsquo;s so grand!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But a Mountain&rsquo;s grander!&rdquo; said Bruno.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is there grand about the Sea?&rdquo; said
the Professor. &ldquo;Why, you could put it all
into a teacup!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Some</i> of it,&rdquo; Sylvie corrected him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;d only want a certain number
of tea-cups to hold it <i>all</i>. And <i>then</i> where&rsquo;s
the grandeur? Then as to a Mountain&mdash;why,
you could carry it all away in a wheel-barrow,
in a certain number of years!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t look grand&mdash;the bits of it in
the wheel-barrow,&rdquo; Sylvie candidly admitted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But when oo put it together again&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
Bruno began.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When you&rsquo;re older,&rdquo; said the Professor,
&ldquo;you&rsquo;ll know that you <i>ca&rsquo;n&rsquo;t</i> put Mountains
<span class="pb" id="Page_395">395</span>
together again so easily! One lives and one
learns, you know!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it needn&rsquo;t be the <i>same</i> one, need it?&rdquo;
said Bruno. &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t it do, if <i>I</i> live, and if
<i>Sylvie</i> learns?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I <i>ca&rsquo;n&rsquo;t</i> learn without living!&rdquo; said Sylvie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I <i>can</i> live without learning!&rdquo; Bruno
retorted. &ldquo;Oo just try me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What I meant, was&mdash;&rdquo; the Professor began,
looking much puzzled, &ldquo;&mdash;was&mdash;that you don&rsquo;t
know <i>everything</i>, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I <i>do</i> know everything I know!&rdquo; persisted
the little fellow. &ldquo;I know ever so many
things! Everything, &rsquo;cept the things I <i>don&rsquo;t</i>
know. And Sylvie knows all the rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Professor sighed, and gave it up. &ldquo;Do
you know what a Boojum is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>I</i> know!&rdquo; cried Bruno. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the thing
what wrenches people out of their boots!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He means &lsquo;bootjack,&rsquo;&rdquo; Sylvie explained
in a whisper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ca&rsquo;n&rsquo;t wrench people out of <i>boots</i>,&rdquo; the
Professor mildly observed.</p>
<p>Bruno laughed saucily. &ldquo;Oo <i>can</i>, though!
Unless they&rsquo;re <i>welly</i> tight in.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_396">396</div>
<p>&ldquo;Once upon a time there was a Boojum&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
the Professor began, but stopped suddenly.
&ldquo;I forget the rest of the Fable,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;And there was a lesson to be learned from
it. I&rsquo;m afraid I forget <i>that</i>, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>I&rsquo;ll</i> tell oo a Fable!&rdquo; Bruno began in
a great hurry. &ldquo;Once there were a Locust,
and a Magpie, and a Engine-driver. And the
Lesson is, to learn to get up early&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t a bit interesting!&rdquo; Sylvie said contemptuously.
&ldquo;You shouldn&rsquo;t put the Lesson
so soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When did you invent that Fable?&rdquo; said
the Professor. &ldquo;Last week?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; said Bruno. &ldquo;A deal shorter ago
than that. Guess again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ca&rsquo;n&rsquo;t guess,&rdquo; said the Professor. &ldquo;How
long ago?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, it isn&rsquo;t invented yet!&rdquo; Bruno exclaimed
triumphantly. &ldquo;But I <i>have</i> invented
a lovely one! Shall I say it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;ve <i>finished</i> inventing it,&rdquo; said Sylvie.
&ldquo;And let the Lesson be &lsquo;to try again&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Bruno with great decision. &ldquo;The
Lesson are &lsquo;<i>not</i> to try again&rsquo;!&rdquo; &ldquo;Once there
<span class="pb" id="Page_397">397</span>
were a lovely china man, what stood on the
chimbley-piece. And he stood, and he stood.
And one day he tumbleded off, and he didn&rsquo;t
hurt his self one bit. Only he <i>would</i> try again.
And the next time he tumbleded off, he hurted
his self welly much, and breaked off ever so
much varnish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how did he come back on the chimney-piece
after his first tumble?&rdquo; said the
Empress. (It was the first sensible question
she had asked in all her life.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>I</i> put him there!&rdquo; cried Bruno.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;m afraid you know something about
his tumbling,&rdquo; said the Professor. &ldquo;Perhaps
you pushed him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>To which Bruno replied, very seriously,
&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t pushed him <i>much</i>&mdash;he were a <i>lovely</i>
china man,&rdquo; he added hastily, evidently very
anxious to change the subject.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, my children!&rdquo; said the Elfin-King,
who had just entered the room. &ldquo;We must
have a little chat together, before you go to
bed.&rdquo; And he was leading them away, but
at the door they let go his hands, and ran back
again to wish the Professor good night.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_398">398</div>

<p class="center small">&lsquo;GOOD-NIGHT, PROFESSOR!&rsquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Good night, Professor, good night!&rdquo; And
Bruno solemnly shook hands with the old
man, who gazed at him with a loving smile,
while Sylvie bent down to press her sweet lips
upon his forehead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good night, little ones!&rdquo; said the Professor.
&ldquo;You may leave me now&mdash;to ruminate. I&rsquo;m
as jolly as the day is long, except when it&rsquo;s
necessary to ruminate on some very difficult
subject. All of me,&rdquo; he murmured sleepily
<span class="pb" id="Page_399">399</span>
as we left the room, &ldquo;all of me, that isn&rsquo;t
<i>Bonhommie</i>, is Rumination!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>What</i> did he say, Bruno?&rdquo; Sylvie enquired,
as soon as we were safely out of hearing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I <i>think</i> he said &lsquo;All of me that isn&rsquo;t Bone-disease
is Rheumatism.&rsquo; Whatever <i>are</i> that
knocking, Sylvie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sylvie stopped, and listened anxiously. It
sounded like some one kicking at a door. &ldquo;I
<i>hope</i> it isn&rsquo;t that Porcupine breaking loose!&rdquo;
she exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go on!&rdquo; Bruno said hastily. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
nuffin to wait for, oo know!&ldquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_400">400</div>
<h2 id="c25">CHAPTER XXV
<br /><span class="small">LIFE OUT OF DEATH.</span></h2>
<p>The sound of kicking, or knocking, grew
louder every moment: and at last a door opened
somewhere near us. &ldquo;Did you say &lsquo;come in!&rsquo;
Sir?&rdquo; my landlady asked timidly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, come in!&rdquo; I replied. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s
the matter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A note has just been left for you, Sir, by
the baker&rsquo;s boy. He said he was passing the
Hall, and they asked him to come round and
leave it here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The note contained five words only. &ldquo;Please
come at once. Muriel.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_401">401</div>
<p>A sudden terror seemed to chill my very
heart. &ldquo;The Earl is ill!&rdquo; I said to myself.
&ldquo;Dying, perhaps!&rdquo; And I hastily prepared
to leave the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No bad news, Sir, I hope?&rdquo; my landlady
said, as she saw me out. &ldquo;The boy said as
some one had arrived unexpectedly&mdash;&mdash;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope that is it!&rdquo; I said. But my feelings
were those of fear rather than of hope: though,
on entering the house, I was somewhat reassured
by finding luggage lying in the entrance, bearing
the initials &ldquo;E. L.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only Eric Lindon after all!&rdquo; I thought,
half relieved and half annoyed. &ldquo;Surely she
need not have sent for me for <i>that</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lady Muriel met me in the passage. Her
eyes were gleaming&mdash;but it was the excitement
of joy, rather than of grief. &ldquo;I have
a surprise for you!&rdquo; she whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean that Eric Lindon is here?&rdquo; I
said, vainly trying to disguise the involuntary
bitterness of my tone. &ldquo;&lsquo;<i>The funeral baked
meats did coldly furnish forth the marriage-tables</i>,&rsquo;&rdquo;
I could not help repeating to myself.
How cruelly I was misjudging her!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_402">402</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; she eagerly replied. &ldquo;At least&mdash;Eric
<i>is</i> here. But&mdash;&mdash;,&rdquo; her voice quivered,
&ldquo;but there is <i>another</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>No need for further question. I eagerly
followed her in. There on the bed, he lay&mdash;pale
and worn&mdash;the mere shadow of his old
self&mdash;my old friend come back again from
the dead!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Arthur!&rdquo; I exclaimed. I could not say
another word.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, back again, old boy!&rdquo; he murmured,
smiling as I grasped his hand. &ldquo;<i>He</i>,&rdquo; indicating
Eric, who stood near, &ldquo;saved my life&mdash;<i>He</i>
brought me back. Next to God, we must
thank <i>him</i>, Muriel, my wife!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Silently I shook hands with Eric and with
the Earl: and with one consent we moved into
the shaded side of the room, where we could
talk without disturbing the invalid, who lay,
silent and happy, holding his wife&rsquo;s hand in
his, and watching her with eyes that shone
with the deep steady light of Love.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has been delirious till to-day,&rdquo; Eric
explained in a low voice: &ldquo;and even to-day he
has been wandering more than once. But the
<span class="pb" id="Page_403">403</span>
sight of <i>her</i> has been new life to him.&rdquo; And
then he went on to tell us, in would-be careless
tones&mdash;I knew how he hated any display of
feeling&mdash;how he had insisted on going back to
the plague-stricken town, to bring away a man
whom the doctor had abandoned as dying, but
who <i>might</i>, he fancied, recover if brought to
the hospital: how he had seen nothing in the
wasted features to remind him of Arthur, and
only recognised him when he visited the
hospital a month after: how the doctor had
forbidden him to announce the discovery, saying
that any shock to the over taxed brain
might kill him at once: how he had staid on at
the hospital, and nursed the sick man by night
and day&mdash;all this with the studied indifference
of one who is relating the commonplace acts
of some chance acquaintance!</p>
<p>&ldquo;And this was his <i>rival</i>!&rdquo; I thought. &ldquo;The
man who had won from him the heart of the
woman he loved!&rdquo;</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_405">405</div>
<p>&ldquo;The sun is setting,&rdquo; said Lady Muriel,
rising and leading the way to the open window.
&ldquo;Just look at the western sky! What lovely
crimson tints! We shall have a glorious day
to-morrow&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; We had followed her across
the room, and were standing in a little group,
talking in low tones in the gathering gloom,
when we were startled by the voice of the sick
man, murmuring words too indistinct for the
ear to catch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is wandering again,&rdquo; Lady Muriel
whispered, and returned to the bedside. We
drew a little nearer also: but no, this had none
of the incoherence of delirium. &ldquo;<i>What reward
shall I give unto the Lord</i>,&rdquo; the tremulous lips
were saying, &ldquo;<i>for all the benefits that He hath
done unto me? I will receive the cup of salvation,
and call&mdash;and call</i>&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; but here the
poor weakened memory failed, and the feeble
voice died into silence.</p>
<p>His wife knelt down at the bedside, raised
one of his arms, and drew it across her own,
fondly kissing the thin white hand that lay
so listlessly in her loving grasp. It seemed
to me a good opportunity for stealing away
without making her go through any form of
parting: so, nodding to the Earl and Eric, I
silently left the room. Eric followed me down
the stairs, and out into the night.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_406">406</div>
<p>&ldquo;Is it Life or Death?&rdquo; I asked him, as
soon as we were far enough from the house
for me to speak in ordinary tones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is <i>Life</i>!&rdquo; he replied with eager emphasis.
&ldquo;The doctors are quite agreed as to <i>that</i>. All
he needs now, they say, is rest, and perfect
quiet, and good nursing. He&rsquo;s quite sure to
get rest and quiet, here: and, as for the nursing
why, I think it&rsquo;s just <i>possible</i>&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; (he tried hard
to make his trembling voice assume a playful
tone) &ldquo;he may even get fairly well nursed, in
his present quarters!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure of it!&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Thank you so
much for coming out to tell me!&rdquo; And, thinking
he had now said all he had come to say, I
held out my hand to bid him good night. He
grasped it warmly, and added, turning his face
away as he spoke, &ldquo;By the way, there is one
other thing I wanted to say. I thought you&rsquo;d
like to know that&mdash;that I&rsquo;m not&mdash;not in the
mind I was in when last we met. It isn&rsquo;t&mdash;that
I can accept Christian belief&mdash;at least,
not yet. But all this came about so strangely.
And she had prayed, you know. And I had
prayed. And&mdash;and&mdash;&rdquo; his voice broke, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_407">407</span>
I could only just catch the concluding words,
&ldquo;<i>there is a God that answers prayer!</i> I know
it for certain now.&rdquo; He wrung my hand once
more, and left me suddenly. Never before had
I seen him so deeply moved.</p>
<p>So, in the gathering twilight, I paced slowly
homewards, in a tumultuous whirl of happy
thoughts: my heart seemed full, and running
over, with joy and thankfulness: all that I had
so fervently longed for, and prayed for, seemed
now to have come to pass. And, though I reproached
myself, bitterly, for the unworthy suspicion
I had for one moment harboured against
the true-hearted Lady Muriel, I took comfort
in knowing it had been but a passing thought.</p>
<p>Not Bruno himself could have mounted the
stairs with so buoyant a step, as I felt my way
up in the dark, not pausing to strike a light
in the entry, as I knew I had left the lamp
burning in my sitting-room.</p>
<p>But it was no common <i>lamplight</i> into which
I now stepped, with a strange, new, dreamy
sensation of some subtle witchery that had come
over the place. Light, richer and more golden
than any lamp could give, flooded the room,
<span class="pb" id="Page_408">408</span>
streaming in from a window I had somehow
never noticed before, and lighting up a group of
three shadowy figures, that grew momently
more distinct&mdash;a grave old man in royal robes,
leaning back in an easy chair, and two children,
a girl and a boy, standing at his side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you the Jewel still, my child?&rdquo; the
old man was saying.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, <i>yes</i>!&rdquo; Sylvie exclaimed with unusual
eagerness. &ldquo;Do you think I&rsquo;d <i>ever</i> lose it or
forget it?&rdquo; She undid the ribbon round her
neck, as she spoke, and laid the Jewel in her
father&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>Bruno looked at it admiringly. &ldquo;What a
lovely brightness!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just like a
little red star! May I take it in my hand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sylvie nodded: and Bruno carried it off to
the window, and held it aloft against the sky,
whose deepening blue was already spangled
with stars. Soon he came running back in
some excitement. &ldquo;Sylvie! Look here!&rdquo; he
cried. &ldquo;I can see right through it when I hold
it up to the sky. And it isn&rsquo;t red a bit: it&rsquo;s, oh
such a lovely blue! And the words are all
different! Do look at it!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_409">409</div>
<p>Sylvie was quite excited, too, by this time;
and the two children eagerly held up the Jewel
to the light, and spelled out the legend between
them, &ldquo;<span class="small">ALL WILL LOVE SYLVIE</span>.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img" id="fig46">
<img src="images/i409.jpg" alt="THE BLUE LOCKET" width="373" height="500" />
<p class="center small">THE BLUE LOCKET</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, this is the <i>other</i> Jewel!&rdquo; cried
Bruno. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you remember, Sylvie? The
one you <i>didn&rsquo;t</i> choose!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sylvie took it from him, with a puzzled look,
and held it, now up to the light, now down.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s blue, <i>one</i> way,&rdquo; she said softly to herself,
&ldquo;and it&rsquo;s red, the <i>other</i> way! Why, I thought
there were <i>two</i> of them&mdash;Father!&rdquo; she suddenly
exclaimed, laying the Jewel once more in
his hand, &ldquo;I do believe it was the <i>same</i> Jewel
all the time!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_410">410</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then you choosed it from <i>itself</i>,&rdquo; Bruno
thoughtfully remarked. &ldquo;Father, <i>could</i> Sylvie
choose a thing from itself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, my own one,&rdquo; the old man replied
to Sylvie, not noticing Bruno&rsquo;s embarrassing
question, &ldquo;it <i>was</i> the same Jewel&mdash;but you
chose quite right.&rdquo; And he fastened the ribbon
round her neck again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="small">SYLVIE WILL LOVE ALL&mdash;ALL WILL LOVE
SYLVIE</span>,&rdquo; Bruno murmured, raising himself on
tiptoe to kiss the &lsquo;little red star.&rsquo; &ldquo;And, when
you look <i>at</i> it, it&rsquo;s red and fierce like the sun&mdash;and,
when you look <i>through</i> it, it&rsquo;s gentle
and blue like the sky!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God&rsquo;s own sky,&rdquo; Sylvie said, dreamily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God&rsquo;s own sky,&rdquo; the little fellow repeated,
as they stood, lovingly clinging together, and
looking out into the night. &ldquo;But oh, Sylvie,
what makes the sky such a <i>darling</i> blue?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sylvie&rsquo;s sweet lips shaped themselves to
reply, but her voice sounded faint and very
far away. The vision was fast slipping from
my eager gaze: but it seemed to me, in that
last bewildering moment, that not Sylvie but
an angel was looking out through those trustful
<span class="pb" id="Page_411">411</span>
brown eyes, and that not Sylvie&rsquo;s but an angel&rsquo;s
voice was whispering</p>

<h2 id="c27"><span class="sc">Works by Lewis Carroll.</span></h2>
<h3>SYLVIE AND BRUNO. First Part.</h3>
<p class="center">With forty-six Illustrations by <span class="sc">Harry Furniss</span>. 12mo, cloth extra, gilt, $1.50.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A charming book for children. The illustrations are very happy.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Boston
Traveller.</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;Alice was a delightful little girl, but hardly more pleasing than are the hero
and heroine of this latest book from a writer in whose nonsense there is far more
sense than in the serious works of many contemporary authors.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Morning Post.</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Furniss&rsquo;s illustrations, which are numerous, are at once graceful and full
of humor. We pay him a high compliment when we say he proves himself a
worthy successor to Mr. Tenniel in illustrating Mr. Lewis Carroll&rsquo;s books.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>St.
James&rsquo;s Gazette.</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;Bruno and Sylvie are wholly delightful creations, the Professor is worthy to
rank with the immortal Pickwick, and there is an endless fund of enjoyment in the
Gardener and his wonderful songs.... The pictures by Harry Furniss are incomparably
good.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Boston Beacon.</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Sylvie and Bruno</i> is characterized by his peculiar and whimsical humor, his
extravagant conceits, and the grotesqueness and inconsistency of plot, characters,
and incidents in his stories.... It is a charming piece of work.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>New York Sun.</i></p>
<h3>ALICE&rsquo;S ADVENTURES IN WONDERLAND.</h3>
<p class="center"><i>One Hundredth Thousand.</i> With forty-two Illustrations by <span class="sc">Tenniel</span>. 12mo, cloth, gilt, $1.00.
<br />Also a German Translation. 12mo, $2.00.
<br />A French Translation. 12mo, $2.00.
<br />An Italian Translation. 12mo, $2.00.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An excellent piece of nonsense.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Times.</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;That most delightful of children&rsquo;s stories.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Saturday Review.</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;That delectable and truly imaginative work.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>New York Sun.</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably no other book has ever filled just the place that <i>Alice in Wonderland</i>
has held in the hearts of children and grown people during the last twenty
years.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Every Thursday.</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Alice in Wonderland</i> and its sequel <i>Through the Looking-Glass</i> are known
wherever the English tongue is spoken. They are classics of their kind and
could in no wise be improved upon.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>St. Louis Republic.</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Alice in Wonderland</i> is the most delightful imaginative composition of late
years for boys and girls.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>The Boston Globe.</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;Love for children and keen sympathy with them in the delightfully primitive
views they take of life is one of the distinctive characteristics of Lewis Carroll.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>The
Churchman.</i></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_426">426</div>
<h3>THROUGH THE LOOKING-GLASS, AND WHAT ALICE FOUND THERE.</h3>
<p class="center"><i>Sixtieth Thousand.</i> With fifty Illustrations by <span class="sc">Tenniel</span>. 12mo, cloth, gilt, $1.00.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will fairly rank with the tale of her previous experience.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Daily Telegraph.</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;Many of Mr. Tenniel&rsquo;s designs are masterpieces of wise absurdity.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Athen&aelig;um.</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;Whether as regarding author or illustrator, this book is a jewel rarely to be
found nowadays.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Echo.</i></p>
<h3>ALICE&rsquo;S ADVENTURES IN WONDERLAND, and THROUGH THE LOOKING-GLASS, AND WHAT ALICE FOUND THERE.</h3>
<p class="center">With all the Illustrations. Printed in one volume, on thinner paper, cloth, $1.25.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We know of no books in the whole range of juvenile literature so full of
genuine and boundless fun as these.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Boston Evening Transcript.</i></p>
<h3>THE NURSERY ALICE.</h3>
<p class="center">Containing twenty colored enlargements from <span class="sc">Tenniel&rsquo;s</span> Illustrations to <i>Alice&rsquo;s Adventures in Wonderland</i>, with text adapted to Nursery Readers by <span class="sc">Lewis Carroll</span>. 4to, colored cover, $1.50.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let the little people rejoice!&mdash;the most charming book in the world has appeared
for them. <i>The Nursery Alice</i>, with its wealth of colored illustrations
from Tenniel&rsquo;s pictures, is certainly the most artistic juvenile that has been seen
for many and many a day.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Boston Budget.</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a charming book, both in pictures and in text, for the little ones of the
nursery. It is a sort of miniature of <i>Alice in Wonderland</i>, and will no doubt
have a circulation and become as great a favorite among the wee ones as the larger
volume has among the older children.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Christian at Work.</i></p>
<h3>ALICE&rsquo;S ADVENTURES UNDER GROUND.</h3>
<p class="center">Being a Fac-simile of the original MS. Book afterward developed into <i>Alice&rsquo;s Adventures in Wonderland</i>. With twenty-seven Illustrations. 12mo, $1.50.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_427">427</div>
<h3>THE HUNTING OF THE SNARK.</h3>
<p class="center">An Agony in Eight Fits. With nine Illustrations by <span class="sc">Henry Holiday</span>. <i>New Edition.</i> Cloth, gilt, $1.00.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a very pretty edition of the verses which should have made their author
famous, even if he had never written <i>Alice in Wonderland</i>. The Snark, like

<p>&ldquo;It seems to me not at all easier to draw a lifelike child than to draw a lifelike
man or woman: Shakespeare and Webster were the only two men of their
age who could do it with perfect delicacy and success; at least, it there was
another who could, I must crave pardon of his happy memory for my forgetfulness
or ignorance of his name. Our own age is more fortunate, on this
single score at least, having a larger and far nobler proportion of female writers;
among whom, since the death of George Eliot, there is none left whose touch
is so exquisite and masterly, whose love is so thoroughly according to knowledge,
whose bright and sweet invention is so fruitful, so truthful, or so
delightful as Mrs. Molesworth&rsquo;s. Any chapter of <i>The Cuckoo Clock</i> or the
enchanting <i>Adventures of Herr Baby</i> is worth a shoal of the very best novels
dealing with the characters and fortunes of mere adults.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="sc">Mrs. A. C.
Swinburne</span>, in <i>The Nineteenth Century</i>.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_429">429</div>
<h3>MRS. MOLESWORTH&rsquo;S
<br /><span class="sc">Stories for Children</span>.</h3>
<p>&ldquo;There is hardly a better author to put into the hands of children than Mrs.
Molesworth. I cannot easily speak too highly of her work. It is a curious art she
has, not wholly English in its spirit, but a cross of the old English with the Italian.
Indeed, I should say Mrs. Molesworth had also been a close student of the German
and Russian, and had some way, catching and holding the spirit of all, created a
method and tone quite her own.... Her characters are admirable and real.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>St.
Louis Globe-Democrat.</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Molesworth has a rare gift for composing stories for children. With a
light yet forcible touch, she paints sweet and artless, yet natural and strong, characters.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Congregationalist.</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Molesworth always has in her books those charming touches of nature
that are sure to charm small people. Her stories are so likely to have been true
that men &lsquo;grown up&rsquo; do not disdain them.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Home Journal.</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;No English writer of childish stories has a better reputation than Mrs. Molesworth,
and none with whose stories we are familiar deserves it better. She has a
motherly knowledge of the child nature, a clear sense of character, the power of
inventing simple incidents that interest, and the ease which comes of continuous
practice.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Mail and Express.</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;Christmas would hardly be Christmas without one of Mrs. Molesworth&rsquo;s stories.
No one has quite the same power of throwing a charm and an interest about the
most commonplace every-day doings as she has, and no one has ever blended fairy-land
and reality with the same skill.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Educational Times.</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Molesworth is justly a great favorite with children; her stories for them
are always charmingly interesting and healthful in tone.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Boston Home Journal.</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Molesworth&rsquo;s books are cheery, wholesome, and particularly well adapted
to refined life. It is safe to add that Mrs. Molesworth is the best English prose
writer for children.... A new volume from Mrs. Molesworth is always a treat.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>The
Beacon.</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;No holiday season would be complete for a host of young readers without a
volume from the hand of Mrs. Molesworth.... It is one of the peculiarities of
Mrs. Molesworth&rsquo;s stories that older readers can no more escape their charm than
younger ones.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Christian Union.</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Molesworth ranks with George Macdonald and Mrs. Ewing as a writer of
children&rsquo;s stories that possess real literary merit.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Milwaukee Sentinel.</i></p>
<p class="center">THE SET, TEN VOLUMES, IN BOX, $10.00.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_430">430</div>
<h3>TELL ME A STORY, and HERR BABY.</h3>
<p>&ldquo;So delightful that we are inclined to join in the petition, and we hope she may
soon tell us more stories.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Athen&aelig;um.</i></p>
<h3>&ldquo;CARROTS&rdquo;; Just a Little Boy.</h3>
<p>&ldquo;One of the cleverest and most pleasing stories it has been our good fortune to
meet with for some time. Carrots and his sister are delightful little beings, whom
to read about is at once to become very fond of.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Examiner.</i></p>
<h3>A CHRISTMAS CHILD; A Sketch of a Boy&rsquo;s Life.</h3>
<p>&ldquo;A very sweet and tenderly drawn sketch, with life and reality manifest throughout.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Pall
Mall Gazette.</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a capital story, well illustrated. Mrs. Molesworth is one of those sunny,
genial writers who has genius for writing acceptably for the young. She has the
happy faculty of blending enough real with romance to make her stories very practical
for good without robbing them of any of their exciting interest.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Chicago
Inter-Ocean.</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Molesworth is one of the few writers of tales for children whose sentiment
though of the sweetest kind is never sickly; whose religious feeling is never
concealed yet never obtruded; whose books are always good but never &lsquo;goody.&rsquo;
Little Ted with his soft heart, clever head, and brave spirit is no morbid presentment
of the angelic child &lsquo;too good to live,&rsquo; and who is certainly a nuisance on
earth, but a charming creature, if not a portrait, whom it is a privilege to meet
even in fiction.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>The Academy.</i></p>
<h3>THE CUCKOO CLOCK.</h3>
<p>&ldquo;A beautiful little story.... It will be read with delight by every child into
whose hands it is placed.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Pall Mall Gazette.</i></p>
<h3>GRANDMOTHER DEAR.</h3>
<p>&ldquo;The author&rsquo;s concern is with the development of character, and seldom does
one meet with the wisdom, tact, and good breeding which pervade this little
book.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Nation.</i></p>
<h3>TWO LITTLE WAIFS.</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Molesworth&rsquo;s delightful story of <i>Two Little Waifs</i> will charm all the
small people who find it in their stockings. It relates the adventures of two lovable
English children lost in Paris, and is just wonderful enough to pleasantly wring the
youthful heart.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>New York Tribune.</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;It is, in its way, indeed, a little classic, of which the real beauty and pathos
can hardly be appreciated by young people.... It is not too much to say of the
story that it is perfect of its kind.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Critic and Good Literature.</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a charming little juvenile story from the pen of Mrs. Molesworth,
detailing the various adventures of a couple of motherless children in searching
for their father, whom they had missed in Paris, where they had gone to meet
him.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Montreal Star.</i></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_431">431</div>
<h3>THE TAPESTRY ROOM.</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Molesworth is the queen of children&rsquo;s fairy-land. She knows how to
make use of the vague, fresh, wondering instincts of childhood, and to invest
familiar things with fairy glamour.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Athen&aelig;um.</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;The story told is a charming one of what may be called the neo-fairy sort....
There has been nothing better of its kind done anywhere for children, whether we
consider its capacity to awaken interest or its wholesomeness.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Evening Post.</i></p>
<h3>CHRISTMAS-TREE LAND.</h3>
<p>&ldquo;It is conceived after a happy fancy, as it relates the supposititious journey of a
party of little ones through that part of fairy-land where Christmas-trees are supposed
to most abound. There is just enough of the old-fashioned fancy about
fairies mingled with the &lsquo;modern improvements&rsquo; to incite and stimulate the youthful
imagination to healthful action. The pictures by Walter Crane are, of course,
not only well executed in themselves, but in charming consonance with the spirit
of the tale.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Troy Times.</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Christmas-Tree Land</i>, by Mrs. Molesworth, is a book to make younger readers
open their eyes wide with delight. A little boy and a little girl, domiciled in a
great white castle, wander on their holidays through the surrounding fir-forests,
and meet with the most delightful pleasures. There is a fascinating, mysterious
character in their adventures and enough of the fairylike and wonderful to puzzle
and enchant all the little ones.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Boston Home Journal.</i></p>
<h3>A CHRISTMAS POSY.</h3>
<p>&ldquo;This is a collection of eight of those inimitable stories for children which none
could write better than Mrs. Molesworth. Her books are prime favorites with
children of all ages, and they are as good and wholesome as they are interesting
and popular. This makes a very handsome book, and its illustrations are excellent.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Christian
at Work.</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>A Christmas Posy</i>, by Mrs. Molesworth, is lovely and fragrant. Mrs. Molesworth
succeeds by right to the place occupied with so much honor by the late Mrs.
Ewing, as a writer of charming stories for children. The present volume is a
cluster of delightful short stories. Mr. Crane&rsquo;s illustrations are in harmony with
the text.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Christian Intelligencer.</i></p>
<h3>THE CHILDREN OF THE CASTLE.</h3>
<p>&ldquo;<i>The Children of the Castle</i>, by Mrs. Molesworth, is another of those delightful
juvenile stories of which this author has written so many. It is a fascinating
little book, with a charming plot, a sweet, pure atmosphere, and teaches a wholesome
moral in the most winning manner.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>B. S. E. Gazette.</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>The Children of the Castle</i> are delightful creations, actual little girls, living
in an actual castle, but often led by their fancies into a shadowy fairy-land. There
is a charming refinement of style and spirit about the story from beginning to end;
an imaginative child will find endless pleasure in it, and the lesson of gentleness
and unselfishness is so artistically managed that it does not seem like a lesson, but
only a part of the story.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Milwaukee Sentinel.</i></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_432">432</div>
<h3>FOUR WINDS FARM.</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Molesworth&rsquo;s books are always delightful, but of all none is more charming
than the volume with which she greets the holidays this season. <i>Four Winds
Farm</i> is one of the most delicate and pleasing books for a child that has seen the
light this many a day. It is full of fancy and of that instinctive sympathy with
childhood which makes this author&rsquo;s books so attractive and so individual.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Boston
Courier.</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;Still more delicately fanciful is Mrs. Molesworth&rsquo;s lovely little tale of the <i>Four
Winds Farm</i>. It is neither a dream nor a fairy story, but concerns the fortune
of a real little boy, named Gratian; yet the dream and the fairy tale seem to enter
into his life, and make part of it. The farmhouse in which the child lives is set
exactly at the meeting-place of the four winds, and they, from the moment of his
birth, have acted as his self-elected godmothers.... All the winds love the boy,
and, held in the balance of their influence, he grows up as a boy should, simply
and truly, with a tender heart and firm mind. The idea of this little book is essentially
poetical.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Literary World.</i></p>
<h3>NURSE HEATHERDALE&rsquo;S STORY.</h3>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Nurse Heatherdale&rsquo;s Story</i> is all about a small boy, who was good enough,
yet was always getting into some trouble through complications in which he was
not to blame. The same sort of things happens to men and women. He is an
orphan, though he is cared for in a way by relations, who are not so very rich, yet
are looked on as well fixed. After many youthful trials and disappointments he
falls into a big stroke of good luck, which lifts him and goes to make others happy.
Those who want a child&rsquo;s book will find nothing to harm and something to interest
in this simple story.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Commercial Advertiser.</i></p>
<h3>&ldquo;US.&rdquo;</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Molesworth&rsquo;s <i>Us, an Old-Fashioned Story</i>, is very charming. A dear
little six-year-old &lsquo;bruvver&rsquo; and sister constitute the &lsquo;us,&rsquo; whose adventures with
gypsies form the theme of the story. Mrs. Molesworth&rsquo;s style is graceful, and she
pictures the little ones with brightness and tenderness.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Evening Post.</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;A pretty and wholesome story.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Literary World.</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Us, an Old-Fashioned Story</i>, is a sweet and quaint story of two little children
who lived long ago, in an old-fashioned way, with their grandparents. The story
is delightfully told.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Philadelphia News.</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Us</i> is one of Mrs. Molesworth&rsquo;s charming little stories for young children.
The narrative ... is full of interest for its real grace and delicacy, and the exquisiteness
and purity of the English in which it is written.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Boston Advertiser.</i></p>
<h3>THE RECTORY CHILDREN.</h3>
<p>&ldquo;In <i>The Rectory Children</i> Mrs. Molesworth has written one of those delightful
volumes which we always look for at Christmas time.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Athen&aelig;um.</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;Quiet, sunny, interesting, and thoroughly winning and wholesome.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Boston
Journal.</i></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_433">433</div>
<p><i>The Rectory Children</i>&mdash;&ldquo;There is no writer of children&rsquo;s books more worthy
of their admiration and love than Mrs. Molesworth. Her bright and sweet invention
is so truthful, her characters so faithfully drawn, and the teaching of her
stories so tender and noble, that while they please and charm they insensibly distil
into the youthful mind the most valuable lessons. In <i>The Rectory Children</i> we
have a fresh, bright story that will be sure to please all her young admirers.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Christian
at Work.</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>The Rectory Children</i>, by Mrs. Molesworth, is a very pretty story of English
life. Mrs. Molesworth is one of the most popular and charming of English story-writers
for children. Her child characters are true to life, always natural and attractive,
and her stories are wholesome and interesting.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Indianapolis Journal.</i></p>
<h3>ROSY.</h3>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Rosy</i>, like all the rest of her stories, is bright and pure and utterly free from
cant,&mdash;a book that children will read with pleasure and lasting profit.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Boston
Traveller.</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no one who has a genius better adapted for entertaining children than
Mrs. Molesworth, and her latest story, <i>Rosy</i>, is one of her best. It is illustrated
with eight woodcuts from designs by Walter Crane.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Philadelphia Press.</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;... Mrs. Molesworth&rsquo;s clever <i>Rosy</i>, a story showing in a charming way how
one little girl&rsquo;s jealousy and bad temper were conquered; one of the best, most
suggestive and improving of the Christmas juveniles.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>New York Tribune.</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Rosy</i> is an exceedingly graceful and interesting story by Mrs. Molesworth, one
of the best and most popular writers of juvenile fiction. This little story is full of
tenderness, is fragrant in sentiment, and points with great delicacy and genuine
feeling a charming moral.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Boston Gazette.</i></p>
<h3>THE GIRLS AND I.</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps the most striking feature of this pleasant story is the natural manner
in which it is written. It is just like the conversation of a bright boy&mdash;consistently
like it from beginning to end. It is a boy who is the hero of the tale, and he tells
the adventures of himself and those nearest him. He is, by the way, in many
respects an example for most young persons. It is a story characterized by sweetness
and purity&mdash;a desirable one to put into the hands of youthful readers.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Gettysburg
Monthly.</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;... A delightful and purposeful story which no one can read without being
benefited.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>New York Observer.</i></p>
<h3>MARY.</h3>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Mrs. Molesworth&rsquo;s last story.</span> <i>Just Ready.</i></p>
